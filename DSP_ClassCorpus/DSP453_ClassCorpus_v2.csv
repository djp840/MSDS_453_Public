KHS_Doc1_TheRing,KHS,Horror,Negative,The Ring,"Described as a drama, horror and mystery, The Ring is just that  a horrifically filmed, allegedly dramatic work, the mystery of which is how and why this movie was ever made. Based on the Japanese novel, Ringu, and a remake of the 1998 Hideo Nakata Japanese film of the same name written by Hiroshi Takahashi, The Ring is the story of a mysterious videotape that kills each of its viewers seven days after seeing the tape. Watch the tape, the phone rings and an ominous voice tells you that you will die. Wait a week and then die. Piece of cake.or so it seems.
As luck would have it, a young teenaged girl named Katie who has a journalist for an aunt, dies after seeing the tape, sending her aunt into investigative mode as to the cause of Katies death. Initially Aunt Rachel views the alleged myth of the tape with great cynicism and skepticism, but after suffering nightmares and some bizarre physical symptoms, not to mention realizing that her young son has viewed the tape, she begins to believe that there is something evil going on here and there just may be some truth to the legacy and age old horror stories.
The tape itself is masterfully eerie and bizarre  grainy, sepia-toned and black & white footage depicting a collection of images seemingly compiled from the worst nightmares of the world  writhing maggots, burning trees (not bushes), covered cisterns, stormy nights, dead creatures, dismembered yet moving fingers and a ring-like tunneling vision like the eye of a tornado. And of course, strange visions of people and places which with a bit of video technology and good old fashioned detective work, prove to be key to the tape and is mysteries.
With only five days to go until D-Day after her viewing the tape, Rachel embarks on a full scale investigation together with her ex-boyfriend and father of her son, Noah, taking her into the woods of the Pacific Northwest and deep into the horrors of the once well-to-do Morgan family.
Naomi Watts stars as Rachel. Unfortunately, her bright beginning in the film rapidly reduces to that of a dim and flickering bulb as her performance gets increasingly erratic before settling into the mindless banality of the zombies in the campiest horror films ever made. A talented actress, I have to believe that her performance (or lack thereof) is due to the Ehren Krugers poor script and Gore Verbinskis even worse directing. Martin Henderson seems aptly cast as the non-committal/non-family man, Noah, a character that we really dont expect that much from and thus, are actually pleasantly surprised at some of the development the character actually does make. David Dorfman as young Aidan Keller, is impressive but it seems as if Verbinski tried to make him into a clone of Haley Joel Osment in his Sixth Sense starring role. Sorry guys  it didnt work. Dorfman has always been engaging in his recurring television performances on Family Law and perhaps television is where he should remain for awhile longer. Well find out next month when he heads up the cast of the much anticipated A Wrinkle In Time based on the time-honored Caldecott award winning book by Madeline LEngle.
Director Gore Verbinski, best known for Mouse Hunt and The Mexican (and next up The Pirates of the Caribbean) has proven he has talent, although going from Mouse Hunt to The Mexican and now to The Ring it seems to be steadily deteriorating. He uses Hitchcockian techniques of close-ups on inanimate objects and creepy crawly flying things (including some birds) very artfully and effectively to create tension, but then cant carry over these small nuances to the big picture to scare the pants off you. Instead, he loses the story and the audience and gets a laugh instead of a collective terrifying gasp or shriek.
Although visually stimulating, cinematographer Bojan Bazelli cant save the film from its own idiocy as the story goes from the bad to worse and finally becomes ridiculously absurd  which accounts for the almost non-stop chortling of the audience.
This is a film that screams stop already at the 30 minute mark, yet like the Energizer Bunny (but nowhere near as cute), it keeps going and going and going and going to excess. Writer Ehren Kruger, who previously brought us Scream 3 and Reindeer Games (the latter of which also had explanation upon explanation contained throughout) clearly has a penchant for wanting to be mysterious (and in this case, creepy) yet explain away all the mystery. Unfortunately, he doesnt know understand the less is more concept  especially in the supernatural fright flick.
A horrifically terrifying film-going experience  to be sure. A horrifically terrifying film? No way. The only thing possibly worse than actually watching The Ring will be paying the late fees when it goes to video and it takes you seven days just to view it.

KHS_Doc2_TheRing,KHS,Horror,Negative,The Ring," I hated it, but I grant that it does tap into a vein of technological horror - the fear of the VCR! - that will have young videophiles chatting it up for weeks. It's already generating ""Blair Witch"" buzz on the Internet. Adapted from both a series of Japanese novels and the Japanese film, TV and comic-book franchise they spawned, ""The Ring"" is certainly the strangest movie to come out of a Hollywood studio (DreamWorks) this year. It's an art-house B movie with philosophical pretensions, a murky story line and a disturbing, sequel-promising ending. A terrific lead performance from Aussie actress Naomi Watts, who emerged as a potential star in David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive,"" is about the only thing I enjoyed about it. Watts plays Rachel Keller, a Seattle newspaper reporter and single mom, whose investigation into the death of a teenage niece puts her and her young son's life in jeopardy. In the film's long tease opening, the niece dies of a heart attack exactly seven days after watching a strange videotape and receiving a telephone call giving her a week to live. Ace reporter that she is, Rachel retraces her niece's steps to a wooded motel cabin where she finds the haunted video, and pops it into the VCR for her own viewing pleasure. It's a weird, symbolism-rich short, something you'd see at a festival of bad student films, with Dali-esque images suggesting family tragedy on a horse farm next to the sea. Having received her ""death call,"" Rachel enlists the aid of Noah (New Zealander Martin Henderson), a video expert who happens to be her ex-boyfriend and the father of her psychic son, Aidan (David Dorfman). Of course, he watches it and gets a telephone call himself. Then, Aidan, after sneaking a peek in the middle of a sleepless night, gets his call. ""The Ring"" follows Rachel and Noah as they race the clock to deconstruct the video and take away its power. Their clues are provided mostly by Aidan, who is channeling the ghost of a young girl in the video. Verbinski - who directed the Brad Pitt/Julia Roberts fiasco, ""The Mexican"" - is a fine visual stylist, and ""The Ring,"" shot in the rain and mist of the Pacific Northwest, is deftly atmospheric and genuinely creepy. The editing, full of quick cuts and foreboding, is hip enough for a music video. While ""The Ring"" is a contextual dead ringer for the recent ""FearDotCom"" (sub the video with a Web site), the movie it most resembles in spirit is David Cronenberg's far superior ""Videodrome,"" about a late-night TV program that infects the minds of its viewers. The hallucinatory quality of that film's imagery continues to haunt me, in ways ""The Ring"" never will. But the subsequent video revolution deserves its own benchmark horror film, which the Japanese version, ""Ringu,"" is among Asians, and which Verbinski's could become in the West. ""Ringu,"" by the way, screens next weekend at the Walter Reade Theater, as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center series ""Scary Movies: 30 Years of Horror,"" which begins today.

KHS_Doc3_TheRing,KHS,Horror,Negative,The Ring,"Ehren Kruger (no relation to Freddy) showed a genuine gift for suspense and character in 1999's ""Arlington Road"", but his efforts since then (""Scream 3"", ""Reindeer Games"") have been disappointing. With ""The Ring"", Mr. Kruger adapts the 1998 Japanese film ""Ringu"" which spawned two sequels and was itself based on a novel. Admittedly, Mr. Kruger gives it the old college try. But there's no saving the fact that the film simply has a silly premise: you watch a videotape that contains about 4 minutes worth of creepy imagery (though it's nothing compared to a Nine Inch Nails or Marilyn Manson video). When the tape is done, your phone rings. When you pick on the phone, a girl's voice says ""seven days"" - meaning, you have seven days to live. And sure enough, exactly seven days later your dead body is found doing an impression of Munch's ""The Scream"".
Okay, where do I begin to mock this plot? What if you watch the tape twice, do you get three and a half days then? If you fast forward through it do you get fourteen? How about pausing it to go to the bathroom? Or only watching half, getting bored and turning it off? Not to mention the obvious: don't answer the phone! This is the stuff of urban myths and certainly with Mr. Kruger's background, he recognizes this. He gives us an effective opening scene, which is itself an homage to ""Scream"" that the rest of the film never matches. And then Mr. Kruger has the unenviable task of explaining all the goings-on in the film. Obviously, with a premise like that one, no amount of explanation is going to suffice, and the more and more he tries, the more the film loses its grip on reality and therefore any real scarAptly-named director Gore Verbinski turns out to be surprisingly adept in presenting unsettling imagery and atmosphere considering his credits include ""Mouse Hunt"" and ""The Mexican"". Perhaps more kudos should go to cinematographer Bojan Bazelli whose work on ""Pumpkinhead"" and ""Body Snatchers"" no doubt came in handy. Regardless of their pedigree, however, both men are working in top form to give Mr. Kruger's script far more dignity than it deserves.The cast, led by Naomi Watts, also invest their all in the story. After David Lynch's elliptical ""Mulholland Drive"", Ms. Watts (sort of a working class Nicole Kidman) proves she can carry a film, though I'm not sure which of these two movies made more sense. Young David Dorfman takes the Haley Joel Osment role as the obligatory boy who knows too much. And Martin Henderson gets by on a smirk as the skeptical boyfriend.In the end though, there's really very little to like about ""The Ring"". The film is eerie for the sake of being eerie. The plot holes are so many and so frequent that the mind buzzes, and you walk out not feeling frightened but bewildered. And of course there's that nagging notion that the premise itself is just plain idiotic. I suppose the scariest part of the film is the fact that I paid to see it."
KHS_Doc4_TheRing,KHS,Horror,Negative,The Ring,"Not all arthouse thrillers are destined to be ruined by Hollywood remakes; Alejandro Amenabar's Open Your Eyes and George Sluizer's The Vanishing may have flopped in their new versions, but Erik Skjoldbjaerg's Insomnia triumphantly resurfaced in the version by Christopher Nolan. As for this remake of the cult Japanese horror film Ring, well, it's disappointing, losing most of the original's flavour, while retaining and amplifying what was muddled and unsatisfying about it in the first place."
KHS_Doc5_TheRing,KHS,Horror,Negative,The Ring,"Rarely has a more serious effort produced a less serious result than in ""The Ring,"" the kind of dread dark horror film where you better hope nobody in the audience snickers, because the film teeters right on the edge of the ridiculous.Enormous craft has been put into the moviewhich looks just great, but the story goes beyond contrivance into the dizzy realms of the absurd. And although there is no way for everything to be explained (and many events lack any possible explanation), the movie's ending explains and explains and explains, until finally you'd rather just give it a pass than sit through one more tedious flashback.The story involves a video that brings certain death. You look at it, the phone rings, and you find out you have seven days to live. A prologue shows some teenage victims of the dread curse, and then newspaper reporter Rachel gets on the case, helped by eerie drawings by her young son, Aida.The story has been recycled from a popular Japanese thriller by, which was held off the market in this country to clear the field for this remake. Alas, the same idea was ripped off in August by "","" also a bad movie, but more plain fun than ""The Ring,"" and with a climax that used brilliant visual effects while this one drags on endlessly.I dare not reveal too much of the story but will say that the video does indeed bring death in a week, something we are reminded of as Rachel tries to solve the case while titles tick off the days. A single mom, she enlists Aidan's father, a video geek named to analyze the deadly tape. He tags along for the adventure, which inevitably leads to their learning to care for one another, I guess, although the movie is not big on relationships. Her investigation leads her to a remote cottage on an island and to the weird, hostile man who lives there. And then the explanations start to pile up.This is Naomi Watts' first move since and I was going to complain that we essentially learn nothing about her character except that she'sa newspaper reporter--but then I remembered that in ""Mulholland Drive"" we essentially learned nothing except that she was a small-town girl in Hollywood, and by the end of the movie we weren't even sure we had learned that. ""Mulholland Drive,"" however, evoked juicy emotions and dimensions that ""The Ring"" is lacking, and involved us in a puzzle that was intriguing instead of simply tedious.There are a couple of moments when we think ""The Ring"" is going to end, and it doesn't. One is that old reliable where the heroine, soaking wet and saved from death, says ""I want to go home,"" and the hero cushions her head on his shoulder. But no, there's more. Another is when Aidan says, ""You didn't let her out, did you?"" That would have been a nice ironic closer, but the movie spells out the entire backstory in merciless detail, until when we're finally walking out of the theater, we're almost ashamed to find ourselves wondering, hey, who was that on the phone?"
KHS_Doc6_TheRing,KHS,Horror,Positive,The Ring,"The opening segment ends on an unsettling note, however. We're presented with a mystery -- it's less comfortingly familiar than a goon in a hockey mask -- andThe Ringstarts to look like something we haven't seen 100 times already.Or maybe we have. It's just that we've seenit in bits and pieces, scattered among a half dozen or so better movies.Based on a 1998 Japanese film that became one of that country's highest grossing movies ever,The Ringis, by definition, unoriginal. But though it is often eerily effective, the most interesting parts all are ... well, let's call them homages to other films.It's got a simple premise that draws on the irresistible appeal of urban legend: A videotape is making the rounds. Anyone who watches it gets a frightening telephone call. For the next seven days, strange things happen. Then they die., a Seattle newspaper reporter, was the aunt of one of the girls in the opening scene. Four teens had watched the tape together, and all four died the same night a week later. Rachel begins to investigate.She watches the tape, then shows it to an old boyfriend, Noah. Her young son, Aidan, also sneaks a peek. Rachel's inquiry becomes a race against time. With building tension, the film counts off the days until Rachel is slated to die.The story occasionally makes little sense, but the mystery and the chills override the confusion. Eventually, a powerful admonition about the treatment of children emerges from the muddled story line. Early in the story, Rachel is late to pick Aidan up from school and barely listens when his teacher advises her to talk with him about what's on his mind. An unloved child turns out to be central to the mystery of the videotape.When Noah first watches the tape, he describes it as ""very student film."" It's true: Whoever made it clearly studiedUn Chien Andalou,Luis Bunuel's disturbing 1929 surrealist collaboration withSalvador Dali. This is but one classic movie that directordraws on.The Ring also occasionally resemblesThe Exorcistin its detached approach and tone, as well as in its tightly wound and uncuddly motherfigureRachel is played byNaomi Watts, an Australian actress who was impressive last year inMulholland Drive,David Lynch's surrealistic thriller that this film also occasionally mimicks. Additionally, echoes ofThe Sixth Senseare most obvious in the character of Aidan, who says he receives messages from ghosts.These all are great films. It's hard to think of better spooky movies to borrow from. This grafted-together ghost story is too uneven to rank with them, but it is genuinely unnerving -- a thought-provoking horror film that packs a visceral wallop.While its more surrealistic touches draw upon primal fears, the film also inventively turns everyday objects such as televisions and videotape cassettes into instruments of horror.If I hadn't seen the more straightforwardly effectiveBelowa few days earlier, I might've been as to be. Images from the movie linger days later. But most of them no longer provoke chills.hemes stick with you in the light of day, ater the scary stuff has faded.The Ringpasses that test. It's just too bad that, days later, I'm still trying to unravel its sometimes illogical plot."
KHS_Doc7_TheRing,KHS,Horror,Positive,The Ring,"A big-budget American remake of a Japanese sensation,The Ringis based on the premise of a cursed video that causes anyone who sees it to die within a week. The problem is not the content of the video (a collection of disconnected black and white images that suggests a surreal editing experiment from the late 1920s), but its anonymous author. Through the course of the film, it becomes apparent that the video was literally ghost-written -- by a malevolent spirit determined to spread its psychic imprint like a virus on the living population.DreamWorks'sThe Ring, directed by Gore Verbinski, feels ghost-written in quite a different way: At best, it's a workmanlike, passably engrossing horror flick that copies well from the Japanese original. When it's good, it's not original, and when it's original, it's not so good.Director Hideo Nakata's originalRingu(1998), based on a novel by Koji Suzuki, had a spooky linearity in its tale of a woman journalist who tries to find the source of a series of teen deaths, including that of her niece. There are much more artistically accomplished and dread-filled Japanese horror films (KiyoshiKurosawa'sCureandPulse) butRinguhas a pop kick (it spawned two sequels), with its vision of a modern Japan of divorced professional mothers, cellphones and videotape, haunted by its past, represented by a remote volcanic island, where malignant spirits lie in wait.Story continues below advertisementIn its opening scene,The Ringis a $60-million film that does a reasonably good impression of a low-budget teen horror tossoff. This is especially true of the prelude (borrowed directly from the Japanese original), which features plaid-skirted teenaged girls alone in a house, talking sex and urban myths.Quickly, though, it switches gears and, initially, there's a happy surprise in the casting. The bird-like Australian actress Naomi Watts (Mulholland Drive) is the perfectlyupdatedHitchcockian heroine, a plucky single mom, Rachel Keller, with her emotions well in check. The sad-eyed David Dorfman is distressingly credible as her semi-neglected eight-year-old son, Aidan, whose teacher is worried about his distressingly death-themed drawings.One of the girls in the prelude, Katie, was Rachel's niece and Aidan's babysitter, and now she has mysteriously died, along with several of her classmates. At the girl's wake, Rachel begins asking questions and traces the tape back to a rustic motel cabin, where the teenagers went to a party.Rachel drives up to the motel, under the gloomy Pacific Northwest sky, rents a room and takes the tape with her. She watches it, gets the phone call and starts to worry. In her anxiety, she turns to her ex-husband, Noah (Martin Henderson), a callow Peter Pan of a man, who happens to know about videos. Despite a slapdash investigation (there's a television detective-show habit of improbable luck andoincidence at work), Rachel finds some pieces of a puzzle: a video image of a lighthouse that she traces to a local island, the location of a horse farm where the horses went mad.There she meets Brian Cox, the remaining figure from a family where things went very badly, but the scene is puzzling. Cox (the original Hannibal in Michael Mann'sManhunter) is large, wet-lipped and rheumy-eyed and, hell yes, he's scary. There's just no particular logic as to why he needs to be that way in the story.Screenwriter Ehren Kruger fails to provide anything beyond one-dimensional characters without background history, a large lapse for a fairly ambitious movie. Given that the entire ghost narrative is related to the effect of a disturbed marriage on a child, it would make sense to offer a tidbit or two about Rachel's own failed marriage. Without real-life grounding, the characters seem little more than functionaries in an elaborate, baffling, paranoid fantasy."
KHS_Doc8_TheRing,KHS,Horror,Positive,The Ring,"Like most horror movies, ""The Ring"" is something of a con game, a baited hook we bite at eagerly even though we aren't really fooled by it. But the line dropped here by director Gore Verbinski and screenwriter Ehren Kruger (adapting the Japanese cult film of the same name) wanders almost accidentally into deep, dark waters. What begins as a routine teen-horror flick -- an urban legend inflated to mythic status -- eventually becomes a clammy, claustrophobic bad dream in which the power of evil cannot be contained by love or death or technology or any other force.I slept fine the night after I saw ""The Ring,"" but the next night was a problem: At a certain point, long after midnight, I found myself sitting bolt upright in bed, completely possessed by two hair-raising moments late in the film. (For those of you who've seen it, one of those will be obvious. The other isthat kid saying that line.)It's a slippery, murky, gray-green film, full of borrowings from ""Twin Peaks,""""The Sixth Sense,""""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""Poltergeist"" and who knows what-all else. But it's also very much its own thing, a deviously engineered parasite that'll crawl under your skin and live in your nervous system for a while if you give it half a chancIt's a pretty dippy premise: There's this weird videotape, see, one you can't find at Blockbuster. You watch it, you get a creepy phone call, and seven days later you die. We open, in fact, with one teenage girl eagerly recounting this scenario to another, who turns ash-white and announces that -- gulp -- she's seen the tape. Seven days earlier. A few minutes later, Teen No. 2 is alone with the TV set, which switches itself on and can't be switched off. Something very bad comes out of it. She dies.The scene is borderline ridiculous and not all that scary. But, importantly, it isn't played for laughs the way most horror-movie killings are these days. It's our first clue that Verbinski and Kruger are after something different, something like the logic and symbology of the unconscious. This death is nothing more than the first go-round, the first iteration in a broadening and deepening pattern that -- as we discover exactly what the human race is up against in ""The Ring"" -- will become very frightening indeed.Verbinski, who's shown little more than empty visual panache in such previous movies as""The Mexican""and ""Mouse Hunt,"" doesn't keep us on the surface of this implausible yarn for long. Rachel (Naomi Watts), a hard-boiled, skeptical journalist who is the dead girl's aunt, begins to investigate teen whispers about the killer tape. She tracks it down easily, of course (the similarity in titles is an accident, but like the central artifact in ""The Lord of the Rings,"" the videotape wants to be found). As soon as she watches it, the halfway plausible world in which the film opens -- a dreary, rain-soaked Seattle that looks like it might be David Lynch's screen-saver -- starts to melt and drip like one of Salvador Dal's pocket watches.Rachel gets the phone call. (A child's voice: ""Seven days."") Nothing seems all that different at first -- except that her face, in photographs, now looks like an unrecognizable smear. She takes the tape to her estranged husband Noah (hunky if forgettable Martin Henderson), a video geek who reports that it wasn't created with a camera or any other known technology. Meanwhile, their son Aidan (David Dorfman), one of those spookily precocious kids who have become ubiquitous in the post-""Sixth Sense"" horror universe, is receiving communications from person or persons unknown and drawing some troubling pictures.This isn't much of an actor's movie, but the beautiful Watts -- the object of considerable Web fandom for her performance in""Mulholland Drive""-- plays Rachel as a finely calibrated instrument gradually going out of tune. Determined to solve the mystery before her seven days are up, Rachel, along with Noah and Aidan, is plunged into a dense and convoluted story that I shouldn't discuss in detail. It involves such archetypal Freudian and/or Jungian elements as a journey to a distant island, a lighthouse, an imprisoned child, an unsolved killing and an epidemic that renders horses suicidal. (One of the most shocking scenes in ""The Ring"" happens outdoors in broad daylight -- or as broad as daylight gets off the Washington coast, anyway -- and features a horse on a ferryboat.What I can talk about is the fact that ""TheRing"" incorporates the language of film surrealism more convincingly than any horror film I can think of since ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Carnival of Souls"" and ""Psycho."" The killer videotape itself is an almost indescribable non-narrative montage in grainy black-and-white -- a woman in a mirror, a man at a window, a ladder against a wall, a centipede crawling from beneath a table and ""the ring,"" a circle of light resembling the corona of a solar eclipse -- that strongly suggests such key surrealist works as Maya Deren's ""Meshes in the Afternoon"" or Luis Buuel's collaboration with Dal, ""Un chien andalou.""As Noah comments after watching the tape (against Rachel's wishes), it's ""very film-student."" At the same time, anybody who's seen those kinds of art movies is familiar with the sensation: They don't make sense, and they're pretty creepy. But where does the creep factor come from? Is it because the images they've planted in our minds actually do add up to something, something that remains just outside our rational grasp?As ""The Ring"" progresses, the boundaries between the film's ""real"" world and the videotape's world give way: The mirror and window appear in a real house (on the distant island, of course) and the ladder appears against a wall outside Noah's loft. A fly that appears on the tape can actually be plucked from the TV screen and set free. ""Before you die you see the Ring,"" Rachel speculates, and indeed this turns out to betruetOK, I'm not actually suggesting that ""The Ring"" is a serious art movie. But it is a seriously scary movie, largely because Verbinski and Kruger (the writer of""Scream 3""and""Arlington Road,""among other films) remain true to the laws of their created universe and don't cheat their audience on the subject of evil. Who created the diabolical videotape in ""The Ring,"" and what do they want? Well, just as in all the truly memorable horror movies, from ""The Exorcist"" to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" the dark forces don't want understanding or love or a Christian burial -- they just want to terrify and destroy us."
KHS_Doc9_TheRing,KHS,Horror,Positive,The Ring,"Paul Schrader turns Auto Focus into an anti-sex dirge; The Ring adds, Dont watch that tape! Almost every time I see a film by Paul Schrader, I think about what a sensational subject he has gotten hold of and how I wish that someone else had stepped in to bring it to life. As a screenwriter, hes drawn to volcanically conflicted protagonists, but the movies he builds around them are austere, even clinical. His script of Taxi Driver (1976) was a smashing success because Martin Scorsese, a voluptuous Expressionist, brought it to a boil: It entered your bloodstream like a drug. Scorsese cooks; Schrader freeze-dries. I think his asceticism is meant to seem classical and contemplative (he once dismissed Taxi Driver as juvenilia), but it feels more like a failure of sympathetic imagination. He wontor cantgo all the way.In Auto Focus(Sony Pictures Classics), Schrader seems almost relieved to have as his protagonist a befuddled pipsqueaka man who picks up a bad habit, sinks into druggy depravity, then leaves this world with no tragic awareness, still clueless. The movie tells the story of Bob Crane (played by Greg Kinnear), the 60s sitcom actor from Hogans Heroes who was found bludgeoned to death in a hotel room in 1978. After the murder, the press discovered that Crane led a shadow life, that the other side of the glib sitcom hero was a man obsessed with documenting his hundreds of sexual conquests on film and video. Cranes afterlife has a neat element of drama, too, as documented in a recent New York Times Magazine article by Lynn Hirschberg: The son from one marriage regards his fathers life as a sordid waste; the son from the other thinks his dad was a sexually liberated hero and has uploaded the hard-core films and tapes to a Web site for public consumption. (I would report on their quality, but they kept crashing my Internet connectionthere goes $3.95!)It would have been a terrific idea to make a movie in which these two views were played off each other, but Schradera confessed former porn addictleans too far to one side to mine that rich dialectic. Auto Focus is a cautionary tale of addiction. What kills Crane, it says, is a lethal combination of sex, video, and celebrity: Because of his fame he can go to bed with a different woman (or several) every night. And because the mid-60s marks the birth of a new technologyhome videoand hes pals with a celebrity hanger-on named John Carpenter (a prodigiously cretinous Willem Dafoe) who works at Sony, he can videotape his conquests and relive them whenever he wants to. Which is basically all the time.Kinnear, Michael Rodgers, and Willem Dafoe get nastyThe movie starts out in a breezy style withlounge-lizard music (by Angelo Badalamenti) and a palette like 50s dinnerwarechartreuse, turquoise, dusty rose. But as Cranes addiction estranges him from his family and derails his career, the camera gets shaky and the lighting harsh and the colors like the inside of a latrine. Crane leaves his first wife (Rita Wilson) for the actress who played Hilda on Hogans Heroes (Maria Bello), but he cant stay faithful to her, either. In his last decade Crane hits the dinner-theater circuit, looking more and more bloated and pathetic as he (along with Carpenter, who shares the booty) trades on his celebrity to score. In one scene, he spies a pair of attractive women and directs the bartender to switch the TV set to a channel with reruns of Hogans Heroes. Then he feigns amazement when hes recognized.The come-on actually worksCrane gets laid. But heres what you dont see in Auto Focus: the pleasure of the act itself or any human tenderness in its aftermath. What was Crane like when the sex was over? A dismissive creep or a nice guy? Did he and these women ever talk? Was anything meaningful ever exchanged besides bodily fluids? Those of us who viewed the infamous Rob Lowe hotel-sex tape werent repulsed because hed gone to bed with a fanI imagine there arent many celebrities, major or minor, who havent, including Schraderor even, necessarily, because he unceremoniously stood aside to let a pal of his get into the act. It was the total indifference displayed toward the woman. Schrader doesnt give us this crucial bit of information about Cranemaybe because Crane reportedly liked women and had fun with them. One of the creepiest things about this film is that the parade of females who go to bed with Crane seem more interchangeableand more expendableto the director than they do to the protagonist.In an interview on National Public Radios Fresh Air, Schrader told Terry Gross that Crane was obsessive-compulsive in other aspects of his life: He didnt just catalog women and videotapes, he cataloged things like his childrens games. Why isnt that in the movie? My guess is that Schrader found it too particular to Crane, and too psychological. Schrader isnt interested in this one guy and his individual tics, hes interested in the hellfire of sex plus video plus celebrity; so he treats Crane with a scientific condescension, as a casualty of an overly permissive and enabling culture. You cant really moralize about obsessive-compulsive behavior.The Auto Focus script is credited to Michael Gerbosi (from a book by Robert Graysmith), but its godfathers are producers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, who wrote Ed Wood (1994), The People vs. LarryFlynt (1996), and Man on the Moon (1999)biopics with a spoofy tone. (Even at their seediest, the heroes of those films have a gee-whiz ingenuousness.) Their stance worked with Ed Woodlargely because Tim Burton had such sympathy for the protagonists awkward but earnest attempts at using Grade Z horror and science-fiction for self-expression. It bombed in Man on the Moon, because the writers didnt attempt to divine the source of Andy Kaufmans aggression, and because the director, Milos Forman, chose to package the story the way he packages everythingas the parable of a martyred nonconformist. Whats depressing about Auto Focus isnt its portrait of addiction, its the mixture of insight-free facetiousness with Schraders chill severity. Kinnear and Dafoe are like loser swingers in a Saturday Night Live sketch. They make friendship look almost as unappetizing as sex.The casting makes the filmmakers intentions plain. In the Hogans Heroes re-creations, Kinnear has the right shallow smirkiness (and Kurt Fuller gets Werner Klemperers rococo hamming as Col. Klink down cold). But in the last third, Kinnear has no depths as an actor to plumb; even in the movies best scenes, with Ron Leibman (in top form) as his brusque but softhearted agent, he looks fatuously dazed. Youd never know that Crane had any gifts as a performer, or that his Hogan was such a smart piece of characterization. The sitcom has a bad reputation for obvious reasons, but apart from its Nazi context (OK, thats a big apart from), it had a solid comic counterculture premise: It was about a laid-back American hipster making jackasses of the master race. Crane was a perfect wise-guy hero for the mid-60s: Breezy but with a beady eye on the main chance, he radiated both sleaziness and supreme competence. He was as much a precursor to Alan Aldas Hawkeye Pierce in the TV version of M*A*S*H as Donald Sutherland was in the 1970 movie. But Schrader and Kinnear give him no stature as either a man or a performer. Auto Focus could be subtitled, Diary of a superficial man.In movies, addiction is a tricky business. You dont want to glamorize it, but if you start with too dire a picture you raise the question: Why would anyone want to do this stuff in the first place? Im an admirer of films like Drugstore Cowboy (1989) and the first half of Requiem for a Dream (2000)anti-addiction movies that nonetheless have sympathy for the ways in which people seek transcendence and end up enslaved. Theres no empathy in Schraders depiction of Bob Crane, no attempt to understand what the man tried to get from sex and video. Schrader is like a reformed addict who isnt even honest enough to show what once gave him pleasure. Hes the most dangerous kind of crusader. In Auto Focus, he makes you hate sex and movies equally.The Japanese horror phenomenon Ring (1998) isnt much of a movie, but it has a couple of eerie effects, a blood-freezing climax, and an irresistible premise: Its about a videotape that kills you (we dont, until the end, know how) exactly seven days after you watch it. As Film Comment editor Gavin Smith says in an article I wrote in last Sundays New York Times, its an old-fashioned curse picture with a clever high-tech twist: It preys on our love/hate addiction to television. Ring takes video, which has made horror feel safer than it did in the days before movies could be purchased at your local gas station, and makes it dangerous again.The Ring: A lethal movieMost Hollywood remakes of foreign hits lose 90 percent in translation, but The Ring (DreamWorks), directed by Gore Verbinski from a script by Ehren Kruger, loses only about 25 percent, and mostly makes up for that with a few original flourishes and a fine turn by the yummy Naomi Watts (of Mulholland Drive [2001]). Watts plays an investigative journalist who watches the tape (as research), then has seven days to discover its origins to keep from turning into a screaming-skull corpse with pop-out eyes. The filmmakers have wisely stayed close to the originals mood, which is somber and flat, with quick (near-subliminal) inserts and a soundtrack full of watery-grave groans and murmurs. Theyve also come up with a killer dead-horse motif. The movie is meant to get into you like a virus, and it does.Verbinski and Kruger have made the lethal video a shade literal for my taste: In the Japanese version it was more abstract and, hence, more scarily irrational; here its imagery tells too much of a story. Along the same lines, the climactic appearance of the wraith is in too-sharp focus. Leave it to the auto-focus-obsessed Japanese to realize that theres nothing more terrifying in the middle of the frame than a giant blur.Correction: In last weeks Bowling for Columbine review, I misstated the figures on gun possession in Canada versus the United States. We have three times more guns per capita than our neighbors in the Great White North. But we have way, way more than three times the number of gun murders per year, so Moores point (and mine) remains valid. The fact that Canadians have so many guns and didnt think to use them on Moore when he strolled up their front steps and into their unlocked houses says much about their national characterfor better and worse.

KHS_Doc10_TheRing,KHS,Horror,Positive,The Ring,"Gore Verbinskis The Ring , from a screenplay by Ehren Kruger, is not some Wagnerian operatic film, as its title might suggest, but rather a remake of a 1998 box-office bonanza of a Japanese horror film entitled Ringu , directed by Hideo Nakata, from a book by Kji Suzuki, who is celebrated as the Stephen King of Japan. Ive never seen the Japanese version, but I have read that Mr. Verbinskis English-language remake retains the two modern inventions serving as instruments of fear and shock in the original: a telephone with the loudest and most jarring rings you are ever likely to hear on any soundtrack, and the fateful and fatal videocassette that condemns anyone watching it to die in seven days. One can only speculate about the malignant associations that Japanese audiences are prepared to attribute to such modern intrusions into their ancient culture as telephones and videocassettes, which serve as the tools of evil avengers from the land of the dead.In this respect, Mr. Verbinskis production of The Ring probably received the green light from the financial powers-that-be on the basis of the phenomenal international commercial success of M. Night Shyamalans The Sixth Sense (1999), which, like The Ring , asks us to believe that the dead can come back to haunt us from the grave. Come to think of it, there was a crucial videocassette in The Sixth Sense as well.Unfortunately, The Ring is not nearly as coherent and consistent as The Sixth Sense , which finally did make some internal sense in that the end did not contradict everything that had gone before. By contrast, Mr. Verbinski and Mr. Kruger seem to make up new rules as they go along, with the result that at the final fade-out we are left hanging, able to figure out neither what else is about to happen, nor exactly what has already happened and who is responsible for it.Still, I found The Ring moderately absorbing, largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound, for which I must thank the direction of Mr. Verbinski, the cinematography of Bojan Bazelli, theproductiondesignofTom Duffield, the editing of Craig Wood, the costume design of Julie Weiss, the music by Hans Zimmer, the visual-effects supervision of Charles Gobson, and the ghastly and ghostly special makeup effects by the renowned Rick Baker. But lets face it: These days Ill go to anything with rising star Naomi Watts in it. Here she does not disappoint, though her role as Rachel, a perpetually overwrought investigative journalist and single mother, is hardly worthy of the break-out talents she displayed in David Lynchs Mulholland Drive (2001). Nonetheless, she gives a charmingly good-sport, Ill-scream-on-cue performance to jolly things along. She is handicapped somewhat by having to tend to David Dorfmans inadequately calibrated performance as Aidan, a creepy child character shamelessly patterned after Haley Joel Osments uncanny turns in both The Sixth Sense and Steven Spielbergs A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001).The Ring begins with two teenage friends, Katie (Amber Tamblyn) and Becca (Rachael Bella), hanging out in an unattended home and schmoozing about a mysterious tape that Katie had seen with her boyfriend Josh a week before, after which the phone rang and Katie was told that she would die in seven days. The phone rings again after Becca has left Katie alone downstairs, and as we later learn, Katie dies mysteriously, with a ghoulishly contorted expression of horror on her face. We learn that Katies boyfriend Josh has also died just as mysteriously, as have another teenage couple-all four deaths supposedly following the showing of the mysterious tape. For her part, Becca is trundled off to an insane asylum after having discovered Katies body the next morning.After all this hullabaloo, Ms. Watts Rachel, Katies aunt, enters the scene to attend her nieces funeral and listen to her sisters plea that she get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding all four fatalities. Rachel is initially skeptical of the videotape rumor, but when she accidentally discovers the tape and proceeds to screen it, the phone rings, and her death sentence is pronounced for seven days hence. What alarms her even more is that her son has stumbled upon the tape and seen it, too-and, even more ominously, knows much more about Katies death than all the grownups. Suddenly gripped by constant hysteria, Rachel calls upon Noah (Martin Henderson), her former lover and Aidans father, to help her solve the puzzle. Noah has always been level-headed, as well as an expert in all forms of electronic communications, though also a bit too cynical and irresponsible for Rachels taste.All this character information is imparted on the fly, amid innumerable ringings of the phone and screenings of the tape, with its signature opening of a ring consisting of two ominously concentric circles which is eventually shown to represent a well cover concealing an old crime that is the key to the mystery. The pacing remains frantically kinetic, with the camera huffing and puffing to keep up with terrified humans fleeing from or rushing toward the frightening unknown. As the contents of the tape are explored for clues to the mortal curse, a strange spectacle of crazed horses on a horse farm owned by Richard and Anne Morgan (Brian Cox and Shannon Cochran) begins to dominate the screen. Madness spreads like a plague from the Morgans to their horses, and to their hallucinatory daughter Samara, a name with an Arabic connotation of death. Through this maze, more metaphysical than metaphorical, Rachel soldiers on with Noah at her side, until the horror engulfs them both. Could this be a parable about the mind-numbing violence and psychosis of the times in which we live and die, as if we were all accursed? Perhaps Ive seen one down movie too many, and The Ring is it. I should add that Jane Alexander, as Dr. Grasnik, makes a late but welcome entrance to clarify and stabilize the tottering narrative, but she is soon gone, and the film is left free to plunge into chaos.Ambitious Gay LoveVentura Pons Food for Love , from David Leavitts novel The Page Turner , is one of many recent movies with explicitly gay protagonists involved in various stages of soft-core seduction and promiscuity. We have come a long way from the days more than a century ago when homosexuality of the male variety was synonymous with decadence and depravity in plays like The Green Bay Tree and novels like The Servant . I stress the male variety of gayness, because there seems to be a double standard for straight males when it comes to watching two men perform on the screen ( ugh! ) as opposed to two women ( ahh! ). Perhaps the former is more threatening than the latter. After all, guys have enough problems, what with all the current psychobabble about homoeroticism in the most sacred male group activities and buddy relationships.As for Food for Love , I havent read Mr. Leavitts novel nor seen any of Mr. Pons previous films, and I dont know the burgeoning category of gay and lesbian cinema as well as I might or should. But I suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject-if, indeed, gayness is the subject of Food for Love , interwoven as it is with the themes of careerism in the classical-music world and the painful relationship between a gay son and his square mother.Kevin Bishop plays Paul Porterfield, an 18-year-old hunk of a piano student given the opportunity to serve as a page-turner for his idol, world-famous pianist Richard Kennington (Paul Rhys), at the peak of his career professionally but on the decline emotionally.Paul is accompanied everywhere by his ditheringly devoted and ambitious mother, Pamela Porterfield (the marvelously overqualifiedJuliet Stevenson), whose unseen husband is about to leave her for another woman as the film begins, causing her to cling ever more tenaciously to her son. The absence of a father figure in Pauls life provides what little motivation of the Penguin-edition Freud variety there is in Pauls intense infatuation with Kennington and his own gay promiscuity.At Kenningtons concert, Paul is first approached by Joseph Mansourian (Allan Corduner), Kenningtonsmiddle-aged agent and long-time lover. Paul deflects Mansourians advances and seemingly concentrates on letting himself be seduced by Kennington.Suddenly, the action shifts fromSanFranciscoto Barcelona (instead of Rome, as in the book), where Paul and Pamela are sightseeing when Paul discovers that Kennington has just given a concert in the city. Paul rushes to the pianists hotel and resumes their affair. Pamela assumes that Paul and Kennington are just friends with a mutual passion for music. But Kennington soon tires of Paul and his mother as a steady social diet, and returns suddenly, like the creature of impulse he is, to his home base in New York.When Paul starts Juilliard, he is soon heartbroken to discover that he is not talented enough to become a concert pianist, but he finally resigns himself to a humbler existence and a genuinely closer and more honest relationship with his mother, who at last accepts her son for what he is by telling him the mythological story of Ganymede as a sign of her enlightenment. I cant help thinking that these gay themes are treated more persuasively in the insightful HBO series Six Feet Under , simply because gay characters are seen more realistically as part of a predominantly straight world. Even so, the melodious msuic of Food for Love almost justifies the titles invocation of the opening benediction by Orsino in Shakespeares Twelfth Night .Vintage Clouzot Henri-Georges Clouzots Quai des Orfvres (1947), from a screenplay by Clouzot (1907-1977) and Jean Ferry, based on the novel Legitime Defense by Stanislas A. Steeman, was released in New York in 1948 under the gamier title of Jenny Lamour , but was never taken seriously over here because the genre prejudices of the time decreed that a film noir or policier or detective-story musical-all of which Clouzots opus can claim to be-lacked sufficient social significance to qualify as a serious form of cinematic expression. Looking at this flick today, one can surmise that Clouzot was a little bit ahead of his time in some respects, and very much of his time in others. For example, Clouzots preMarshall Plan Paris was still suffering from food shortages, as reflected by a characters receiving some black-market liquid butter in a clandestine operation.Most of the action takes place at night, inasmuch as the milieu is one of nightclubs with circus acts as well as late-night love nests. Louis Jouvets Detective-Lieutenant Antoine is investigating the murder of a lecherous producer named Brignon (Charles Dullin). The main suspect is Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blier, father of director Bertrand Blier), husband and piano accompanist for his sexy songbird, Marguerite Martineau, a.k.a. Jenny Lamour, her stage name. Aside from leading Brignon on to secure a movie contract-and thus making her husband insanely jealous-Jenny is openly adored by her best friend, the lesbian photographer Dora Monier (Simone Renant). This was scorchingly hot stuff for Production Codecontrolled Hollywood in 1948, as was Antoines little African boy, the only result of his colonial duties as a former Foreign Legionnaire of which he remains proud. Lesbianism and miscegenation! Call the Legion of Decency!The mystery isnt much, and the songs arent much more. Suzy Delair is now almost completely forgotten, and she doesnt even indulge in one of the brazen topless scenes with which French filmmakers were already teasing their audiences way back in the 1930s. Still, Quai des Orfvres is vintage Clouzot, dark, gloomy and misanthropic, with casually sadistic police-interrogation scenes that remind us still that the Paris police have always made an Okefenokee swamp sheriff over here look like a member of the ACLU. The Film Forum is to be congratulated for bringing this fun movie classic back to our attention."
GMI_Doc1_Speedracer.csv,Guruparan Muruguvannan,Action,Positive,Speed racer,"Warner Brothers had been trying to develop a Speed Racer film for nearly two decades, but the project never really launched until it was suggested that perhaps the Wachowskis should direct something beneath an R-rating to introduce them to family audiences.
The movie wasnt very well received, and thats wrong. Cosmically wrong.Speed Raceris brilliant.
Going in, I had no idea what I was in for. Per instructions from my colleague Leah, I went to Hulu first to watch an episode of the 1960s cartoon for reference. This proved to be useful for a few reasons: I now know the theme song; I got a feel for characters and plots and relationships (the Racer familys littlest brother has a pet chimpanzee that he likes to pal around with, for example); I also learned that Speed Racer was anactual name, not some cute nickname or callsign. But having watched that episode, I was considerably more nervous about the filmwhat about this show could possibly make for entertaining cinema?
Then about ten minutes in, I found myself shouting: Why dont people like this movie? Why dont I hear anyone talk about it? This movie is AMAZING. I took to Facebook to demand an explanation, and found that many of my friends loveSpeed Racer, which gives me hope that it will enter the realm of cult classic sooner rather than later. My most profound reaction was, explicitly: I want toeatthis movie.

And when I say that, I dont just meanwow its full of pretty colors and everything looks like candy om nom nom. I mean I literally want to ingest this film and somehow incorporate it into my being, have it leak out through my pores, and then coat the world in its light. I want to feel the way that movie makes me feel every damn day.
Im pretty sure thats the highest compliment I can give a movie.
That isnt to say thatSpeed Raceris the paragon of cinema, or that it is the greatest piece of art ever produced. But in the realm of uniqueness, there is absolutely nothing like it in American cinema, nothing that even tries. It is cheeseball and violently colorful and blatantly anti-capitalist and so very eager it makes me want to cry. And like every other Wachowski film, it is about love and family and supporting one another and making the world a better place.
Look, Im not a race car person. Im also not a sports movie person because they all feel roughly the same to methe emotional beats all add up to the same peaks and valleys every time. ButSpeed Raceris a race car movie and a sports movie, and I would watch every sports movie in the world if they were all like this.
Did I mention that the villain was capitalism? Yup.

For the uninitiated, the Racer family is in the car business (through their small independent company Racer Motors), and Speeds older brother Rex used to be the one who raced family cars in various tournaments. He died in a dangerous race, the Casa Cristo 5000, and Speed took up the family mantledriving his brothers old cars, clearly every bit as talented as his brother was. His success prompts E.P. Arnold Royalton of Royalton Industries to take interest in sponsoring Speed, promising to take him all the way to Grand Prix in style and privilege. Speed decides not to take the spot, and Royalton reveals that the Grand Prix has always been a fixed race to help corporate interests, then vows to destroy Speeds racing career and his family for turning down the offer. Speed is contacted by Inspector Detector of the corporate crimes division, who wants Speed to help him expose criminal activity in Royalton Indutries. Speed agrees, but Royalton does as promised and wipes him out during an important qualifying race, shortly after suing Speeds father for intellectual property infringement and dragging their family business through the mud.

GMI_Doc2_Speedracer.csv,Guruparan Muruguvannan,Action,Positive,Speed racer,"The instant the movie starts, viewers are introduced to a psychedelic world in which fast cars reign supreme and the laws of physics have long been lost. A playground where the color spectrum has evolved (but not the weaponry) plays host to hyperkinetic and dizzyingly dangerous races that prove anything is possible  especially the impossible. The only thing faster than the cars is the speed at which realism flies out the door, but the Wachowski Brothers have managed to create yet another visual universe unlike any other.

As a youth, Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) could think of nothing but the thrill of driving  and to one day become just like his famous racecar driver brother, Rex (Scott Porter). His dreams are almost shattered when tragedy befalls his sibling, but fate intervenes and Speed eventually fulfills his lifelong goal of staying behind the wheel. But his skills catch the eye of nefarious entrepreneur Royalton (Roger Allam), who propositions the young racer with a dastardly ultimatum  race for Royalton Industries or never race again. Determined to defy the scheming extortionist, Speed must face almost certain death in the most dangerous no-holds-barred race of all time  the Casa Cristo Classic 5000. But with the help of the mysterious Racer X, and the support of his family and girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci), the exceptional Racer might just be able to bring honor back to the sport he so loves.

Speed Racer takes the cake for being the most stylistic and unimaginably colorful film ever to grace the screen. Unfortunately, thats the very reason that viewers may turn away from the famous anime-turned-movie. Utilizing more green-screen work than perhaps any other film to date, the backgrounds are almost completely computer generated, as are all of the fantastical racing sequences. New colors must have been invented for the film just to paint the psychedelically bright visuals. And by the conclusion, no law of gravity, physics, momentum, motion, or weight remains unbroken.

The racing scenes are like Star Wars: The Phantom Menaces podracing, without the realism which, of course, never possessed any realism in the first place. Cars spin, bounce, jump, flip, and dance about with no respect for preconceived notions of believable vehicular movement. During the hazardous Casa Cristo event, all of the racecars are equipped with signature James Bond gadgets and weaponry  but in Speed Racer, it feels like watching a round of the Crash Bandicoot racing video game instead of action-packed, high-speed theatrics. Its understandable that the creators wanted to portray a form of breakneck racing unlike anything witnessed on the big screen before, but the drivers are not supposed to be superhuman; and yet every maneuver they incorporate into the roller coaster racetrack seems practical only for those with an acute understanding of the Force  or perhaps for invincible cartoon characters.

Essentially, Speed Racer is about as close to a live-action cartoon as it gets. Nothing remains within the boundaries of realism, especially as the maddeningly stylized editing specifically supports the idea that the characters are about as vulnerable to real life hazards as a cartoon. Traditional animation is mixed into early shots with Spritle (Speeds younger brother) and his pet Chim-Chim (not unlike the opening moments of Son of Rambow, also out this month), scenes are overlayed onto one another with faces and characters sliding across the screen as the backgrounds remain motionless, and the familiar styles of anime fighting are realized in comically edited sequences of slow-motion, sped-up clips, and all methods of disorienting juxtaposition. In the end, though the story is acceptable, the effects are outlandish, and the characters are basically nonsensical, children should find no reason not to watch Speed Racer. And for teens, Trixie is about the only justified motivation to view this astronomically unreal racing adventure."
GMI_Doc3_Speedracer.csv,Guruparan Muruguvannan,Action,Positive,Speed racer,"Complaining that the Wachowski brothersSpeed Raceris too noisy, too busy, too colorful and too over-the-top is a lot like visiting the Grand Canyon and complaining that its too big, or tackling a Wagner opera and kvetching that its too long and too bombastic. In other words, what did you expect? The Wachowskis arent exactly known for their subtlety, so it oughtnt be a big shock to find out that their film version of a frankly lousy cartoon isnt Ingmar Bergman.
Its not a good movie. But I would call it a fascinating failureand add that its at least 30 minutes too long for its own good. The running time listed is either 129 or 135 minutes, depending on the source. I didnt time it, and was fairly quickly driven from the theater by the remonkeyed hip-hop-techno-rave-J-rock-dance-remix version of the cartoons theme song over the end credits. And there are parts of the movie that I actively hated. (My tolerance for precocious kids with cute feces-flinging-chimpanzee sidekicks is sadly limited. Doubtless, this is a personal flaw I should work on correcting.) But all in all, I cant quite climb on the anti-Speed Racerbandwagon, because the film is just too interesting to simply dismiss.
For my money, the Wachowskis peaked with their debut film,Bound(1996). It has all the flash and zip of their subsequent work, but it also has a clever story and the chemistry of Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon going for it.Andit strictly tries to impress the viewer with its cleverness. It isnt peddling a load of clams pretending to be profound, which is exactly what happens withThe Matrix(1999) and its wafer-thin philosophy. That itwasa load of clams was ably demonstrated when the Wachowskis tried to expand and explain with the twoMatrixsequel films, the obvious shallowness of which earned them the kind of enmity one usually encounters when people feel theyve been personally betrayed or made a fool of.
Despite having a family-loyalty underpinning with all the attendant good intentions that implies (kids movies without this are the rare ones) and an anti-big-business mind-set,Speed Racerdoesnt even pretend to have any depth. It barely pretends to have a story of any note, even though it actually has several intersecting story lines. Its pure stylerelentless, overpowering style. That its ultimately also overkill is an admittedly pretty big downside, but Im not at all certain that sensory overload isnt the point. Its certainly what you get, and in more ways than just the fact that very little of what you see besides the actors is real.
The story lines are a convoluted excuse for wallowing in the films hallucinatory Day-Glo stylistic excesses and structural aberrations. All it really comes down to is the story of a kid named Speed Racer (Nicholas Eliah,War) who thinks about nothing other than racing cars (with that name, why is anyone surprised?) and idolizing his race-car-driving brother, Rex (Scott Porter,Prom Night). Speed grows up and becomes the racer of his dreams (and turns into Emile Hirsch in the bargain). Rex is supposedly killed in a racethanks to the forces of evil big businessand Speed has a chance to pay them back etc., etc. Further convolutions about business dealings hardly matter, and there are aspects of the film Id just as soonnotexplore too deeplylike why Speeds girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), bears a striking resemblance to Mom Racer (Susan Sarandon). (Hello, Oedipus!)
Apart from the constant stylization, the films structure is unusual to say the least. Past and present collide so often that the movie threatens to become nonlinear.

GMI_Doc4_Speedracer.csv,Guruparan Muruguvannan,Action,Positive,Speed racer,"The narrowing line between live action and animation is obliterated spectacularly in ""Speed Racer,"" the Wachowski Brothers (""The Matrix"") eyepopping update of the 1960smangaandanimeTV series created by Tatsuo Yoshida. The Wachowskis have whipped up a 136-minute silly symphony of fluorescent colors, gravity-defying car races and cartoonish villains, all served up in a fluid, dreamlike style as sophisticated as the storyline is aggressively childish. This is a movie aimed squarely at the family audienceif the characters' names Mom Racer and Pop Racer (John Goodman and Susan Sarandon) weren't tip-off enough, the scene-stealing pet chimp should give you fair warning.
The gifted race-car driver Speed (Emile Hirsch, looking almost as lean as he did in ""Into the Wild,"" but more clean-cut) is the pure sportsman in a corrupt world of fixed races, dirty drivers (whose cars come equipped with lethal weapons) and multimillion-dollar corporate sponsors. It's a sign of Speed's purity that he turns down a sponsorship offer from the ruthless, money-worshiping head of Royalton Industries (Roger Allam), who responds to this rebuff by threatening to ruin both Speed and his family's proudly independent Racing Motors company. Lest there be any doubt that the ""Matrix"" creators, former indie filmmakers working in the heart of the studio system, see this as a parable of their own careers, Mom Racer tells her talented son, ""You're an artist  What you do is beautiful and inspiring.""
""Speed Racer"" creates a timeless, visually seductive world suspended somewhere between the pop '60s and the sci-fi future. Its biggest disappointment, strangely enough, is its raison d'tre--the races themselves. They lack suspense. The danger of creating a videogame world, where the limitless freedom of CGI replaces the laws of physics, is that the competitions lack any real sense of risk. These flying, flipping racing cars, seemingly impervious to metal-crunching collisions, belong more to the world of Tom and Jerry or the Road Runner than they do to ""The French Connection"" or ""Bullitt."" (Even the races in Pixar's ""Cars"" seemed more down to earth.) ""Speed Racer"" is sweet and flashy and often fun, but its thrills are oddly abstractmore esthetic than visceral. It's the colors you remember, not the crashes.
Curiously enough, David Mamet's ""Redbelt"" tells exactly the same story as ""Speed Racer,"" albeit in a style that couldn't be more different. His hero, Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor), is another sportsman of unshakable principles, a teacher of Brazilian jiujitsu forced to confront a corrupt world of fixed fights and money-grubbing mixed-martial-arts promoters. Instead of CGI, Mamet prefers hand-to-hand combat and the sharp chop of his trademark macho dialogue. But his vision of the pure and the good is not far removed from ""Speed Racer""'s anticorporate (and corporate-sponsored) message. Like Speed, Mike is Mamet's portrait of the artist battling for his integrity in a fallen world. The writer-director overloads his tricky plot with backstabbing Hollywood skullduggeryhis hero is lured into the movie world when he saves the skin of a movie star (Tim Allen) in a bar fightcreating mysteries that never get satisfyingly explained in his surprisingly Hollywoodish third act. But thanks to Ejiofor's wonderful performance--his easy, commanding body language wordlessly convinces you of his character's nobilityand Mamet's knowing take on the arcane world of Brazilian jiujitsu, ""Redbelt"" never loses its muscular hold on your attention.

GMI_Doc5_Speedracer.csv,Guruparan Muruguvannan,Action,Positive,Speed racer,"Speed Racermay very well give your brain diabetes, and I state that as compliment. Digital to the extreme, this adaptation of the popular 70's cartoon is sure to give detractors of theStar Warsprequels a whole new ball game to play at, as it doesn't so much utilize its glossy, computerized sheen as it fully embraces it - like a child with a new set of toys, exploring the seemingly endless possibilities at hand. The aesthetic worth ofSpeed Racerwill only be truly ascertainable in retrospect, but for now it can be appreciated (if for nothing else) as a bold experiment in delirious pop art, an orgasm of exploding rainbows that defies all physical and visual conventions in its no-holds-barred extravagance. One example: when the less fortunate of the film's racing automobiles crash and explode, the plumes of flame and dust could be any one of the colors of the rainbow, as if Andy Warhol was back from the dead, psyched as ever. By comparison,300may as well have been directed by Lars Von Trier.

Plots and themes aside, the Wachowski Brothers have always been readily identifiable as a distinctly auteuristic presence. From the delectable sexuality ofBoundthrough the flawed ambition ofThe Matrixsequels, theirs is a style keyed into what makes us human (even as it resides within special effects-driven spectacles and familiar genre trappings), evoking telling subtleties with their impeccable, almost Kubrickian framing schemes, positioning men and women, leaders and masses, the rulers and the ruled with and against each other, utilizing space in ways traditionally overlooking in supposed popcorn fare.Speed Racermay very well find them shunning more deliberately meaningful filmmaking in favor of youthful nostalgia; having never seen the originalSpeed Racerand caring too little to do so, I'm in no position to comment on whether or not this is just another commercial ploy to remind middle-aged ticket buyers of the Good Old Days. Nevertheless, such is a gimmick I think beneath these boys, who - for all of their shortcomings and bad decisions - have never given out to profitability when doing such would impede on the essence of their vision.


Speed Raceris, at its heart, a family film, even if it isn't inappropriate to recommend watching it on LSD. I can only wonder about the future bootlegs being sold at comic book conventions, pairing the film up with various Pink Floyd songs that somehow match up with its bonkers imagery. The storyline remains one modestly grounded in simple themes and virtues: of David versus Goliath, of remaining true to oneself, of being there for friends at the end of the day. Performers notwithstanding, you can expect the usual Wachowski-directed performances: overly mannered and deliberate but also awkward, flawed, and revealing (the casting of Keanu Reeves as Neo remains one of the most unlikely and brilliant marriages of talent - or, as some would say, lack thereof - and content, in recent cinema), deliberately shaped to fit within the peg holes carved out amidst the landscape of flashing sights and sounds.

Such technical stimuli require nothing short of a leap of faith in this case; hold on, hang tight, and try to not look outside the ride lest the contrasting speeds give you motion sickness.Speed Raceris batshit crazy, constantly refocusing, zooming, panning, cutting, swiping, spinning, and bullet-timing, the equivalent of letting 1,000 hummingbirds loose in a McDonald's ball pit with sugar water in constant supply. The viewer is perpetually in the position of being overwhelmed, and though that's a deliberate effect, there were times (in between the moments in which I attempted to recalibrate my senses) that I wished they'd held back the extravagant editing only just, so as to appreciate the spectacle a little less from the purported perspective the racers (truly, they take the catchphrase ""Go, Speed Racer, go!"" to the ultimate extreme) and more so from the cheering spectators. No matter how fast their gadget spins, however, it stays decidedly on track, not unlike its titular character, whipping around hairpin turns designed precisely for drivers who know how to drive while hydroplaning. In a just world, the editing work inSpeed Racerwould be championed instead of the idiot chaos that isThe Bourne Ultimatum.

GMI_Doc6_Speedracer.csv,Guruparan Muruguvannan,Action,Negative,Speed racer,"I don't pretend to be an expert onSpeed Racer, the 40-year-old manga/import cartoon about a plucky young race-car driver and his supremely annoying family. But by all accounts, directors Andy and Larry Wachowski are deeply steeped in the minutia of his world and their new big-screen adaptation of his adventures is true to that ethos. I have no reason to doubt the film's authenticity or ability to meet the expectations of any die-hard fans out there. It certainly looks appropriately cartoonish and the corny jokes they pass off with a straight face could only stem from early-'70s Saturday-morning filler.
But as a movie,Speed Racermakes very little effort to involve anyone whoisn'ta fan. It wants us to embrace its Day-Glo alternate universe of full-sized Hot Wheels cars without providing a single reason why we should. Its actors serve as living props, placed against a green screen and asked to deliver simplistic emotions devoid of depth or purpose. They are immersed in a labyrinthine plot requiring periodic fits of dull exposition... which never changes the fact that it's basically all about cars going really fast around candy-colored slot tracks. Every character can be defined in a few easily digestible words. Speed (Emile Hirsch) loves racing. His girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) loves Speed. Mom (Susan Sarandon) loves Speed too, while Pops (John Goodman) loves building cars that Speed can drive. Little brother Spritle (Paulie Litt) loves candy. And Speed. And his psychotically infuriating chimpanzee Chim-Chim, who wears overalls and flings poo at the bad guys. There are a lot bad guys, all of whom hate Speed and view racing as nothing more than business. But Speed is really, really good at racing, and he'll show them that plucky individuals really can stand up to their corporate greed (a message coming, once again, in the service of corporate greed). He gets some help from the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox), who likes to lurk in the shadows and brood a lot, and from a bevy of disposable supporting players who basically exist in order to acknowledge the particulars of the old TV show.
That's ostensibly part of the appeal, I suppose, and real humanity clearly has no place here. The Wachowskis dedicate themselves less to the stakes of each race or the impact on Speed and his family if he should lose than the visual kinetics of the world itself. Never has the phrase ""live-action cartoon"" been more appropriate, and that's not an entirely bad thing. CertainlySpeed Racer's palate has a brilliant visual kick, marked by eye-popping primary colors cribbed liberally from Warren Beatty'sDick Tracy. The race tracks feature impossible bends and slot-car loop-the-loops, while everyone's outfits are color-coordinated to match the surrounding decor. The texture gives it all an appreciable internal consistency, and actors like Ricci -- with her big, beautiful eyes and page-boy hairdo -- evoke the artistic sensibilities of anime in ways which no green-screen special effect ever could. In that sense, if nowhere else,Speed Racersucceeds at its task.

GMI_Doc7_Speedracer.csv,Guruparan Muruguvannan,Action,Negative,Speed racer,"Sitting throughSpeed Raceris kind of like playing a video game. Actually, it's more like watching someone else play a video game. It's fun and exciting for about the first fifteen minutes, but the problem is that it runs for more than two hours. As the film opens, we're immediately thrust into a deliciously gooey world of vibrant colors, cool CG visuals and gravity-less properties... a place where Dr. Seuss and Willy Wonka would feel at home playing ring-around-the-rosie. But then as the movie progresses, the sweet outer coating begins slowly melting away, exposing an under-plotted, over-stylized behemoth of a jumbled mess. The Wachowski Brothers, in bringing the 1960s Japanese manga inspired comic and anime cartoon to life, tapped into their overactive creative sides with hopes of bringing a style of auto racing beyond anything we know. But instead they've left us with what happens when a kid gets sick on Starburst candy.
A full confession here: I was never a fan ofSpeed Racerwhen it aired back in the day. It always seemed a little too stylistically prehistoric -- even for the '60s  and emotionally slow-witted for me. But what better opportunity to pick up a new convert! The Wachowski's employed a well-rounded stable ofHollywood's best (veterans and up-and-comers alike), and brought on a wiz special effects team to get the splashiest of visual graphics. But sadly, rather than reenergizing theSpeed Racerlegacy, they end up just puppeting the fine actors around in the splashiest of environments. I'm not introduced to what originally drew the legions of fans to the series. Instead, I'm numbed into a stupor -- not unlike an ice-cream headache.
Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch), the World Racing League's wunderkind, also has a tight family: Mom (Susan Sarandon), Pops (John Goodman), little brother Spritle (Paulie Litt), doe-eyed girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) and family pet chimpanzee, Chim Chim. It's a racing family, so all are involved in one way or another by surrounding Speed with everything he needs to succeed on the track. Whether it's Mom's nourishing peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, the mechanical handiwork of Pops, or Trixie's close observations from a helicopter above the action, Speed is always able to keep his focus where it's needed most, behind the wheel of Mach 6, the family's sleek and thundering race car. From the original series we know Trixie is like a member of the Racer family and is in their home most of the time, but it's a little disturbing when, in the real-life version, she's there even at night.
The central conflict comes from the corruption that embodies modern days sports, here in the personification of billionaire tycoon, E.P. Arnold Royalton (Roger Allams) whose racing team wants to hire Speed to race under its banner. But when Speed learns of the true dishonest nature of the league, he refuses, which sets Royalton out to destroy Speed and family's racing business. Speed's only recourse is to race his way back to the top of the heap.
All actors perform quite admirably, but it's Hirsch and Goodman who stand out in their roles, especially in some of the film's most tender moments. We buy into the emotional impact when Speed tells Pops ""racing's the only thing I know how to do and I gotta do something."" ESPN wasn't able to pull off that line in its Dale Earnhardt special, but here it works. In fact, the family parts of the film are where the Wachowski's find most of their success. But unfortunately,Speed Raceris a racing film
"
GMI_Doc8_Speedracer.csv,Guruparan Muruguvannan,Action,Negative,Speed racer,"It's hard to say whether the Wachowski brothers' live action take on the Japanese Speed Racer cartoons is more irritating because it looks like a Hot Wheels video game or because the brothers seem to think that there's a powerful family drama humming away beneath the flashing lights and spinning wheels. The Racer family is all about cars: Pops Racer (John Goodman) builds them, oldest son Rex (Scott Porter) drives them, younger son Speed (Nicholas Elai) can't think about anything else and Mom (Susan Sarandon) provides sandwiches and unflagging encouragement. But the joy goes out of the family business when Rex and Pops have a falling out; Rex goes on to develop a reputation as a dirty driver before dying in a fiery crash during the arduous Casa Cristo 5000 rally, the family rift still unresolved. Some ten years later, Speed (Emile Hirsch) has matured into one of the World Racing League's best drivers, thanks in part to his zen-like rapport with the Mach 5, his father's masterpiece, and the family has expanded to include Speed's spunky girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), bratty little brother Spritle (Paulie Ltt) and a hyperactive chimpanzee named Chim-Chim. Speed is being courted by smarmy corporate fat cat E.P. Arnold Royalton (Roger Allam), whose drivers are consistent WRL winners, but when he declines to continue racing under the Racer family banner, Royalton turns ugly: He's going to make sure Speed never wins another race, and ruin his family into the bargain. Enter Inspector Detector (Benno Furman) and Racer X (Matthew Fox), supposedly the sport's bad guy but actually an undercover operative trying to expose corporate race fixing: If Speed will work with them, corrupt creeps like Royalton will be forced out. Various contrived complications later, Speed finds himself competing in the Casa Cristo, on a team with Racer X  whom he's begun to suspect might be his brother in disguise  and Taejo Togokahn (Korean pop star Rain), the ambitious scion of another racing dynasty. The trouble with SPEED can be summed up in the Wachowskis' apparent belief that ""You don't race because you're a driver. You race because you're driven"" is a pop mantra whose resonance rivals, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" It's not, and the sight of a top-flight cast gamely trying to bring emotional depth to cartoon characters is disheartening. Credit where it's due: Ricci was born to play an anime girl, and Fox not only manages to wear Racer X's vaguely fetishistic costume without looking pervy but also modulates his voice into a pitch-perfect replica of the tones 1960s-era American dubbing actors favored for older characters. But the look trumps everything, from the aggressively saturated colors and retro-cool CGI backgrounds to the digital rendering that puts the foreground, background and middle ground of every image into equally sharp focus, like a cartoon. It's kind of cool, but it's also more than a little like being trapped in a pinball machine while being asked to feel the Racer family's pain for the better part of two hours.

GMI_Doc9_Speedracer.csv,Guruparan Muruguvannan,Action,Negative,Speed racer,"""Speed Racer"" is not just the latest blockbuster. It's the latest thing in blockbusters. The Wachowski brothers (""The Matrix"") fill the movie with so many new ideas about how to make pictures that it soon becomes fun just to watch those ideas whiz by, even the bad ones. All the same, if this action extravaganza represents the future of movies, it's going to be a sad, dead and awful future.
Thepropositionat work here is whether it's possible to make a movie almost entirely out of flash, commotion and bursts of color. The Wachowskis don't come close to proving it, but they try harder than anyone has ever tried. They take some empty source material - a visually stilted, emotionally stunted cartoon from a generation ago - and stuff it with the best actors they can get and the splashiest effects they can devise. They turn actors into puppets and cinema into a video game. It's ghastly, but they do it on a grand scale.
The fact is, like the toxic gas suspended over a northern New Jersey sunrise, poison can be beautiful. It's gorgeous here: The live action is fed through some computer process, so that every visual pops out. Red is the dominant color, but not just red, but a candy apple red that's so bright and vivid, it all but jumps off the screen and sits in your lap. In an early scene, the young Speed rides in a car with his older brother. The upholstery is red, and the sky is a mix of unearthly dark blue sky and white clouds. It's so pretty that for a minute, it doesn't matter what they're saying. The experience is like walking into your first carnival.
This can't last, but the opening shows what the Wachowskis wanted to do, not for a minute, but for a whole movie: to pound the audience into a delighted stupor. To give people a bacchanalian feast of sights and sounds, with a mere handful of straight scenes for audiences to purge their senses in preparation for the next orgy. Ultimately, the experiment fails, in that the experience becomes numbing, not energizing. But when a movie can make even a bottle of peanut butter look beautiful - and when whole sequences feel like you just put on new glasses after years of being nearsighted - that's something.
Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is a racing prodigy with a tight family, a mom played bySusan Sarandonand a dad played byJohn Goodman, not to mention a little brother with a chimpanzee. Speed has a big-eyed girlfriend named Trixie (Christina Ricci), and the sight of Ricci trying to emulate the mannerisms of a cartoon character is one of the more disturbing things in movies this year. That she does it well - Ricci does everything well - makes it only worse. What a constrained and dreadful conformity for a vibrant and eccentric talent.
The central conflict of ""Speed Racer"" is that a corrupt, billionaire tycoon, Royalton (Roger Allam), wants Speed to race for him. Speed won't do it, and so the tycoon sets out to destroy Speed and his family. Speed's only recourse is to work his magic on the racetrack, and so there are lots of racing scenes. Lots and lots and lots of racing scenes.Carsfly, flip, drive up the side of icy mountains, do cartwheels and burst into flames. These scenes come close to straight-up animation, but they're more like watching a video game - not like playing a video game, but like watching other people play, and for a very long time.
There's a scene in which one car's tire has a sword and another car's tire has a shield, and the two tires duel, as the cars race down a mountain road. If that sounds entertaining, boy have I got a movie for you.

GMI_Doc10_Speedracer.csv,Guruparan Muruguvannan,Action,Negative,Speed racer,"Speed Racer comes to us from the creators of The Matrix, and as my cerebral cortex was reeling from the onslaught of its jelly-belly colors and Lucy in the Sky graphics, I wondered if there was some parallel universe where it might be considered an entertaining experience. Maybe Japan?
This adventurously awful film is awful in many ways at once.
It is, like a Ferrari poking across East 42nd Street at rush hour, fast yet slow. It is futuristically retro. Its attention span is measurable in microseconds, yet it runs more than two hours. And it spent a trillion dollars imitating the look of a 10-cent cartoon from the primitive 60s  artistically, the Cro-Magnon era. I was initially awed by its splendors. But when Id had my fill, there was still an hour-45 left.
Not to whine, but by the end, my eyeballs were on fire.
Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch of Into the Wild) comes from a family with a large carbon footprint. His dad, Pops (John Goodman), makes fast cars, assisted by Mom (Susan Sarandon). His older brother, a champion driver himself, dies young. Perhaps he couldnt bear living a moment longer knowing that  with the last name Racer and parents who were willing to use Speed as a given name  they saved it for the next kid and stuck him with Rex.
Vowing to carry on Rex Racers Earnhardt-esque legacy, Speed hits the racetrack in the opening minutes for a zoomy action scene in which he has a chance to break his brothers records. Much like the other big set pieces in the movie, the race blasts colors and shapes all over the screen. This could well be the most dazzling thing youve ever seen  or it could make you long for the relative serenity of Saturday night at the disco. Either way, its hard to stay interested when the race keeps breaking off into flashbacks.
This movies motto is cut to the exposition  or the monkey. Speed Racer has a little brother at home who is prone to getting in comical situations. I fence the word between quotation marks because the film does. No one is likely to laugh at the squirt as he (for instance) is awed by the sight of a candy display or attacks a ninja by adhering to his calf.
Every time we check in on the scampering of the lil tyke and his pet chimp  20 minutes could have been saved by eliminating them  the racing thrills seem diminished by the jokey context. The Wachowski brothers call their movie motorized kung fu  car fu  but the monkey makes it more like Jar Jar Fu. This is the costliest piece of camp ever manufactured.
Speed is offered a sponsorship by an evil CEO from the Royalton Corp., who uses his stable of talent in a scheme to fix races that affects the price of oil. The CEO spends about 10 minutes explaining this in a scene that has all the narrative pull of the commodities pricing chart in the Financial Times.
Instead of joining the dark side, Speed joins forces with his girlfriend (Christina Ricci) and former rivals Taejo (played by the Korean pop star Rain) and Racer X, a character who has the misfortune to be played by the monotonous Matthew Fox. Hes costumed in one of the shoddiest outfits modeled by a comic-book type since the Riddler pranced around the 1960s Batman TV show in green polyester pajamas with question marks printed on them. Racer X, whose true identity is shrouded, looks like a crossing guard at a school for dorks.

ops_Doc1_Arrival,ops,Sci-Fi,Negative,Arrival,"Arrival a product of the 90's.A small but mildly entertaining film about an alien invasion starring Charlie sheen. With more money this movie might have been really good.The story was thought-provoking, but the execution was sloppy. The pacing was way too slow. They should have trimmed 20 minutes off. And the acting was lackluster by all parties. Plus, the visual effects look pretty corny now, and I doubt they looked that good in 1996. It was a good idea, but the signal got muddled somewhere along the way.  "
ops_Doc2_Arrival,ops,Sci-Fi,Positive,Arrival,"This movie is a creative and beautiful sci-fi film which actually manages to provoke emotions from viewers, at least it did in my case, and seeing by other reviews, any others feel the same way. The movie is never boring, nor slow; throughout it constantly provokes thought and reaches into your heart. It is simply beautiful. The shots, action, and its carefully, elegantly and dare I say again beautiful portrayal of language and its affect on all life. Thematically, visually, and emotionally this movie hits the mark and is a sci-fi film, whether a passionate fan or stranger of the genre, that people should definitely watch - you will most likely enjoy it :)"
ops_Doc3_Arrival,ops,Sci-Fi,Positive,Arrival,"I feel strongly that this film is a masterclass in film-making, as it is able to merge the epic scope of the sci-fi genre, with a story that ultimately centres around motherhood. Without spoiling the film, I'd summarise it as an exploration of the human condition and what it means to be a mother, wrapped under the guise of an alien blockbuster. On a cinematic level, this film is near perfect. Denis Villeneuve manages to create a synthesis of the real-world environment with excellent CGI, creating a more grounded, realistic alien film that isn't very common. The score is unbeatable, with the heart-wrenching melody of Max Richter's ""On the nature of daylight"" swelling in the epilogue, emphasising the heart-wrenching climax of the film. Of course, Amy Adams is superb (as always), as she so fluently, pardon the pun, portrays a confident linguist who creates a realistic balance between her career and her motherhood. This is an incredible character that Amy Adams fantastically portrays. Jeremy Renner is great too, as is Forest Whitaker, but Amy Adams is definitely the star here. To conclude, I implore you to watch this film! It is groundbreaking, as it has not only completely redefined the sci-fi genre for me, but it has reshaped my philosophy regarding mortality and love, and made me think of things in different ways. The film forces you to delve deep into your own life, it forces you to confront your feelings and your regrets, yet you're never taken out of the film - you remain completely immersed in Villeneuve's frighteningly authentic world. I never expected a film that on the surface seemed to be about the arrival of aliens, to instead stir my emotions in a way that very rarely happens with a film."
ops_Doc4_Arrival,ops,Sci-Fi,Negative,Arrival,"Unwatchable. Boring. Slow. I tried three times to watch this and couldn't. I LOVE science fiction but this was like watching paint dry. I disagree with the praise heaped upon this ""film"". It was sci-fi but more Fiction than SCIence. At least it was honest enough to ask initially ""whence did they come, moreover how did they arrive here: Faster than light travel?"" But then it sidetracked into impossible fantasies about time-travel or illusions of it. In short: Forget it; -Do not waste your time watching this film."
ops_Doc5_Arrival,ops,Sci-Fi,Positive,Arrival,HEAVY SPOILERS An impressively complex yet comprehensive Science Fiction/Thriller story that doubles as a commentary on the importance of language. As foreshadowed by the protagonists Louise (Amy Adams) initially interaction with her co-lead Ian (Jeremy Renner) this is an exploration on the universal necessity of communication between sentient creatures. This is inclusive of not only humans and aliens but of humanity itself. The film also successfully presents an argument for why language is the most important weapon. Not to hurt or destroy but to defuse a conflict and mutually benefit everyone. Several factors come into play that raise the stakes of the movie. The first is the inability to communicate which plays out a number of different ways among the nations. Fear and paranoia are exploited by both the media and internet personalities which leads to protests and an assassination attempt later in the film. Pressure is placed on the governments to give answers they don't have.
ops_Doc6_Arrival,ops,Sci-Fi,Negative,Arrival,"Seriously overrated, I think. A boring, low pace movie with no action and too much sappy stuff with the daughter, the one-sided romance and the constant half focused, half scared look on the main female protagonists' face. The unrealistic lack of cooperation between similar research teams, the lack of depth in approaching the challenges and downright weird strategies to encounter the aliens did not help the plot forward. The aliens were boring, treelike creatures. Why bother showing up? Still, I get why the movie got high reviews. It is somewhat entertaining and definitely different. Overall, not a winner for me. Two stars is fair, I think."
ops_Doc7_Arrival,ops,Sci-Fi,Positive,Arrival,"This is one of those rare movies where it exceeds its source material. The theme of time is incredibly well represented and it really comes together at the end. The soundtrack complements the film perfectly, especially the Max Richter song, On the Nature of Daylight. The song would bring anybody to tears on its own but is amplified by this film's revelation. This is one of those films that requires your full attention all the time. Arrival will definitely bring you back a second time, or more to discover something new."
ops_Doc8_Arrival,ops,Sci-Fi,Negative,Arrival,"For an America-centric Hollywood movie I thought it was pretty good. It is atmospheric and I enjoyed the cerebral elements at play. What totally ruined it for me though was the explicitly racist statement that Europeans are a ""superior race"" to Australian Aboriginals, ew gross. And the writers forced a black man to say it, poor Forest Whitaker. This is totally unacceptable in this day in age. We've got aliens who've mastered interstellar travel and are thus obviously far more advanced and intelligent than we are, yet it's up to US to find a way to communicate. That makes this anything but a thinking person's movie, sorry."
ops_Doc9_Arrival,ops,Sci-Fi,Positive,Arrival," A high concept sci-fi movie about a professional linguist who is recruited to communicate with mysterious aliens that suddenly appear on Earth. Amy Adams' performance is nothing short of brilliant, and her interactions with the heptapods are phenomenal! It's an incredibly well structured movie that improves upon repeat viewings. If you like sci-fi and want to see a unique spin on alien encounters, look no further than Arrival. Denis Villeneuve is a wonderful director whose style combines a melancholy sort of bleakness with a glorious flair and passion for cinema evident in his work. Arrival is perhaps the crown jewel."
ops_Doc10_Arrival,ops,Sci-Fi,Negative,Arrival,"Overrated... it's not your typical or traditional alien movie, this movie is mega slow lots of flashbacks and repeat, try to solve this alien language and repeat time its running out, if you are brave to watching this try to watch it as a documental do not expect the typical sci-fi entertainment. Boring from the tedious opening sequent to the end. To me it is one of the most ridiculous films I have ever seen. Over acted, melodramatic, unbelievable dribble. I've never seem so much sadness in the face of a miracle in my life. I thought it was a comedy by Mel Brooks. I kept thinking it was going to get better and it just kept getting stupider."
MSR_Doc1_Hereditary,MSR,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"The much-hyped horror feature has already recouped over three times its $10 million budget and marked the highest-grossing opening of any A24 film. This is a staggering debut given Hereditarys narrative: The films plot gets rolling following a grisly child death, and its experimental, Satan-worshipping story, though compelling, can be difficult to follow. The film is somewhat at odds with itself. As its melodramatic first half leads to a ghoulish denouement, it can feel like Hereditary is unsure of its own genre, but it is consistently wrenching, as the family in the film collapses under the weight of their shared suffering. Hereditary does not just depict a family undone by mental illnessits subjects ultimately fall victim to their shared inability to speak about emotional trauma. Hereditary kicks off with a funeral: The estranged mother of Annie Graham (Toni Collette) has died, and Annie is stumbling her way through a eulogy that describes the deceased matriarch as a woman with private rituals, private friends, private anxieties. The eulogy makes clear that her mothers apparent chilliness and secretive nature was part of the rift between them, and Annie is determined not to repeat history with her 13-year-old daughter, Charlie (Milly Shapiro). The night of the funeral, she encourages Charliewho she notes never even cried as a babyto allow herself catharsis. Similarly, Annies husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), asks their teenage son, Peter (Alex Wolff), if hed like to talk about the difficult day. The children answer their parents with silence and a shrug, respectivelythe films first warning that, despite their parents efforts, it might be too late for the kids to find their emotional voices. Indeed, Annie and Steve consistently model repression, internalizing everything from spooky night visions to grave desecration. Annie lies to Steve about attending a grief support group where, although she shares, her monologue is couched in sarcasm. I have a lot of resistance to things like this, she explains to the group before saying her mothers death wasnt a huge blow. Familial backstory revealed in that same speech sheds light on Annies trauma: A psychotically depressed father who starved himself to death and a schizophrenic brother who hanged himself preceded her mothers death, whose preexisting dissociative identity disorder worsened before she died of natural causes. Annie rattles off that history like a grocery list, only occasionally wavering. I just dont want to put any more stress on my family, she admits at the end. Im not even sure that they could give me that support. The film puts that hypothesis to a gut-wrenching test when, after a series of harrowing mistakes, Charlie is killed in a freak accident. Where the death of Annies mother was uneasy for the family, Charlies death shatters it, with Peter and Annie particularly immersed in guilt and sorrow. A few outbursts aside, their family history of internalizing tragedy prevails: Though Peter witnesses Charlies death, he stomachs it silently, leaving Annie to discover her daughters body; Annies own unbridled grief quickly gives way to numbness. She and Steve both muffle their emotions with pills, while Peter has to steel himself, fists clenched, before he can walk through his own front door. And though hes ill-equipped to deal with his increasingly haunted wife and son, Steve does hint at Annies history of mental illness in a message to her former psychiatrist (Im worried that Annie may be on the verge of, or in the MIDDLE of), but with his note unfinished, viewers are left to try and fill in the blanks of Annies past themselves. The literal destruction of their grieving family unfolds with dreadful inevitability, as both Annie and Peter ultimately die by their own hands. Their deaths, despite paranormal influences, can be interpreted as suicide, in light of the films overt references to mental illness. Despite ever-evolving diagnoses and new forms of therapy, the stigmatization of mental illness in our society is alive and well. Though Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdains tragic deaths recently brought suicide back into the national conversation and, according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, suicide is the 10th most common cause of death in America, the subjectwhen not being glorified or sensationalized in shows like 13 Reasons Whyis still taboo. As Kat Kinsman, who in the wake of Bourdains death wrote about the food industrys culture of stoicism for Food and Wine, put it: You either have to deal with the slightly uncomfortable situation of having your line cook cry in front of you, or you cry at their funeral. Across all classes and all industries, we have engendered a society thats so uncomfortable with negative emotion and that so stigmatizes mental illness that some of us would literally rather die than reveal that we dont know how to navigate our pain. Though gently helpful reminders about crisis lines and sliding-scale therapists follow high-profile suicides, survivors often push back against the idea that the burden of reaching out for help should lie solely on depressed people. As Mark Rowland wrote for the UKs Mental Health Foundation, we need to cultivate a culture where its okay to not be okay. We know logically that emotional repression can augment sufferers mental health difficulties, leading them to experience social isolation, increased aggression, and possibly even early death. And even though Hereditary is, explicitly, a horror film, its particularly jarring to see such a realistic progression play out for its characters, who swallow their grief until it overtakes them. Regardless, the films chilling lesson is timely: When we cultivate societies, families, and institutions that encourage the suppression of messy emotions, our lives become terrifying even before any gory visions and demonic possessions enter into them. In the end, despite all its spooky marketing, Hereditary is a fable about generational silence in the face of mental illness, where the moral of the story is so dark and visceral that audiences feel compelled to look away."
MSR_Doc2_Hereditary,MSR,Horror,Negative,Hereditary,"Hereditary is the horror film that has been described as a ride of pure terror and likened to The Exorcist and Rosemarys Baby and The Shining, to which I can say only: in its dreams. Given Im such a wuss when it comes to anything frightening  the child-catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang still scares the living daylights out of me  Im rather thankful, but Im perplexed as to why it received such rave reviews. Ride of pure terror? Ive had more terrifying rides on the teacups at the fair. I saw it at the paying cinema with my adult son and his girlfriend, who were also bored out of their minds and could only conclude that all other critics are idiots. This is as Ive long suspected, but its useful to have it confirmed. Written and directed by Ari Aster, Hereditary stars an overwrought Toni Collette as Annie, whose mother, Ellen, has just died. Annie had a difficult relationship with Ellen and I initially thought the scene was being set for a horror spin on ambivalent motherhood, which could have been interesting, but I was wrong. Unlike, for example, Get Out, which was clever and made a point, this never felt anything other than pointless. Stuff certainly happens after Ellens death. Symbols and signs appear. A book on spiritualism is discovered. Ellens grave is desecrated. But they occur flatly, as if being ticked off some shopping list. The film is packed with tropes and clichs: a house in the woods, dead birds, a locked room, a creepy attic. These are knowing but there are others that, one suspects, arent knowing at all, and feed into one particular old chestnut: men are calmly sane while women are always hysterical. So Annie is the hysterical one, as is her 13-year-old daughter (Milly Shapiro), who goes all spooky and starts making clucking sounds. She also has an older son, Peter (Alex Wolff), who is not similarly afflicted  hes a typical weed-smoking teenage slacker  while their father, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), has no role to play beyond telling Annie to get a grip. Poor Steve and poor Peter, though, who dont come out of it well. But thats what happens, one must suppose, if you throw in your lot withcrazy ladies. It isnt much of a reveal  its one minute of literal exposition right at the end  and its not much of a build-up to that reveal, as the pacing is so poor. There are decapitated heads and incinerations and rotting corpses but its never dramatic or exciting, and at the viewing I attended the audience laughed at the parts that were intended as the most terrifying, as its all so silly. Plus there are plot holes aplenty, as well as psychological ones. Annie wonders why Peter is so stand-offish with her. I dont know, but might the fact that he once woke up in the middle of the night to find shed doused him in petrol and was about to set fire to him have something do with it? Might it? One last thing, and Ill be vague here, to avoid spoiler accusations, but to those who have already seen this: why did the power have to be transferred to a male form? Why wasnt a girl good enough? Your better bet is The Happy Prince, Rupert Everetts passion project about Oscar Wildes last, wretched years. No,I didnt much wish to see Wilde being driven to his death either, but while the film is sad, it is ravishingly sad, and I just love Everett, whos said so often that his career is over that hes kind of made a career out of it. Respect. Everett wrote, directed, produced and stars as Wilde who, at the point that the story is taken up, has just been released from prison for gross indecency. Shunned by British society, he is forced into exile in France and Italy but, even so, hes cornered in a church one day by a group of Hoorah Henrys out for his blood, and it is so sad, but ravishingly sad, with the light in the church pouring in like melted butter. Using vignettes and flashback, we learn about his few loyal friends, his relationship with his wife and sons, which was devoted if impossible, and how he allowed Bosie to continue to destroy him. This occasionally slips into cheap sentiment, but there are some stand-out scenes  Wilde singing The Boy I Love Is Up In The Gallery, for instance  and, of course, there are some terrific lines. I am dying beyond my means, he will complain on his deathbed. As for Everett, he is terrific. His Wilde is not hagiographic. His Wilde is brilliant but also foolhardy, exploited but also wilfully self-destructive, funny but also pathetic. A sad film, but ravishingly so."
MSR_Doc3_Hereditary,MSR,Horror,Negative,Hereditary,"When her 78-year-old mother dies, Annie Graham (the overexposed Toni Collette, another Australian who appears in more movies these days than Nicole Kidman) and her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) go home to a house in Utah that is bleak, dreary, unfriendly and downright creepy. Hereditary, the long, pretentious occult thriller that follows, boasts the four-word label in film-festival jargon that often reliably guarantee a torturous disaster: Big Hit at Sundance! As alleged horror films go, this one is about as scary as the Bowery Boys in Spooks Run Wild. One week after Mom is buried, Annie finds a secret journal she left behind about spiritualism. Her grave is desecrated, so we know shes coming back. Then the kids go weird. After cutting off the head of a dead bird, socially inept 13-year-old daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) is forced to tag along with her stoned, pot-smoking older brother Peter (Alex Wolff) to a party where she swallows something lethal and on the way home he severs her own head in a fatal car accident. The already loopy Annie goes totally schizophrenic. Oh, yes. Since you asked, there is a husband-father figure in Steve, but all he does is mope around passively, looking catatonic. Through a member of her grief-counseling group who contacted her dead grandson with the help of a medium, Annie conducts her own sance and conjures up Charlie from beyond the grave. Things pick up mildly when gossamer spirits float through the house and Grandmas headless body is found in the attic. Peter goes berserk and bashes his head against his desk in school. Annie tries to destroy Charlies drawing book but her arm catches on fire. Lit only by candles, the freaky house turns into a cross between The Witch and Poltergeist, minus the thrills or imagination of either. Begged by the distributor not to reveal the banal surprises that await you, I will only say that Utah plays the door to Hell and Toni Collette has never appeared more deranged and out of control. First-time director Ari Aster leads her through the gates of insanity and beyond, without a single hair-raising moment. As the incidents in the Graham household intensify, the results grow tragic, but clocking in at more than two hours, Hereditary loses so much momentum that it cant tell the difference between tragedy and tedium. It contains so few gotcha moments that box-office doom seems inescapable (I saw it in a multiplex on a Saturday night with fewer than 20 people in the audience) and there is not even a mandatory throat-tightening payoff. It ends with Judy Collins singing Joni Mitchells ballad Both Sides Now, which makes even less sense than the movie itself. These days actors not only appear in bad movies, they are forced to produce their own flops themselves. Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne co-executive produced Hereditary. They deserve what they get, in spades."
MSR_Doc4_Hereditary,MSR,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"Artist Annie Grahams (Toni Collette) mother is dead. Shes conflicted as to how she should feel, the two of them not very close. However, the woman was especially kind and attentive to Annie and husband Steves (Gabriel Byrne) youngest child Charlie (Milly Shapiro), the two of them sharing a bond that seemed to transcend normal grandmother-granddaughter relationships. As for oldest child Peter (Alex Wolff), its hard to know what he is feeling, the quiet, soft-spoken teenager happier to crush on one of his pretty classmates or sneak a joint with one of his few friends behind the high school gym than he is to talk with his parents about any of his emotional upheavals. It all sounds normal enough. Still, there is a surreal air of plaintive mystery residing inside the Graham house, and Annie finds herself absolutely unable to shake the sense that there is something tragically terrible coming their way. After an unbelievable accident rocks the entire family, this artist, wife and parent begins to crumble inside of herself like she never has before, obsessing over her late mothers history of mental illness and spending an inordinate amount of time with a new friend she met at a grief support group named Joan (Ann Dowd) then could potentially be healthy. Much to Steves chagrin and to Peters growing terror, Annie also claims to be conversing with someone from beyond the grave, and it soon becomes an open question as to whether she is losing her mind or if she really is making paranormal contact with spirits from the other side of deaths door. As if trying to see if it would be possible to combine Ordinary People, The Shining, Dont Look Back, The Ice Storm, Repulsion, Little Children, The Innocents, In the Bedroom and Rosemarys Baby into one cohesive, terrifyingly intimate narrative, writer/director Ari Aster makes a noteworthy debut with the powerfully unsettling, emotionally dexterous horror melodrama Hereditary. Propelled forward by an austere, perfectly calibrated score by musician Colin Stetson (Blue Caprice) and featuring unnerving, beautifully disquieting cinematography from newcomer Pawel Pogorzelski (Tragedy Girls), this movie gets off on the right foot immediately. But it is Collettes stunning, career-best performance that is the anchor point all events happening here are born from, the veteran actress so dialed into the style and tone of Asters story imaging it without her is frankly impossible. How do people deal with their grief? Is tragedy like an aggressive disease, and once it grabs hold of the familial nervous system is there no treatment or cure that will eradicate it without causing additional pain? What are the ways people try and communicate with one another after death strikes and the survivors are left to pick up the pieces? Does fate play a part? Is there a higher power? Does God exist? Does the Devil? Is the supernatural real? Or is it only another bit of fluffy nonsense we delude ourselves into believing in order to ease a pain born out of a deep-rooted inability to forgive ones own self for missteps taken walking upon lifes seemingly never-ending highway? I cant say all of those questions are asked in Asters debut, but there are times throughout the story where it feels as if they are. The director has his mind set on a fairly expansive set of themes and ideas, and the way he attempts to sort through them all is as freewheeling and as imprecise as Annies failing psychological grasp as to all that may or may not be happening inside the secluded house she and her family call home. There is a growing dread that permeates things right down into the roots, the evil attempting to blossom so expansive and destructive it will burn the souls of all who encounter it right down to ash. There is a point where the center is modified, where Annie is no longer standing in the spotlight and another is reluctantly forced to take her place. Its a somewhat jarring tonal shift, and Im not certain that I feel Aster pulls it off. Part of this is because Collette is just so spectacular, so magnificent, having her no longer be the driving influence on what is transpiring takes getting used to. This had a great deal to do with the fact that my emotional attachment to other members of the Graham family wasnt as strong as it was with Annie. She was the one I cared about. She was the one I wanted desperately to understand. Even so, the place Aster ultimately takes things to, while not entirely unexpected, is still gut-wrenching in its power to unnerve and startle, the last scene so fundamentally ghastly in its gorgeous abhorrence I was almost struck dumb by what it was I just had sat there and witnessed. In the end Im forced to be vague about a lot of what goes on here. Asters debut not only gives Collette a spellbinding showcase that by all rights should earn her an Oscar nomination (but because this is a horror movie frustratingly probably will not do so), it also marks the arrival of a major filmmaker whose follow-up will immediately vault to the top of my must-see list for whatever calendar year it ends up being released in. This is high-octane nightmare fuel that had me shivering all the way home with my stomach twisted into a series of painful knots I had trouble believing I was ever going to be able to unwind, Hereditary a go-for-broke stunner overflowing in a myriad of petrifying mysteries many will be attempting to decipher for a number of years to come."
MSR_Doc5_Hereditary,MSR,Horror,Negative,Hereditary,"Breathless comparisons to The Exorcist, The Shining and Psycho do this fitfully frightening yet ultimately frustrating chiller few favours. Talented writer-director Ari Asters flawed feature debut has more in common with such recently challenging titles as The Witch or It Comes at Night (both also distributed in the US by indie-kings A24), although this tale of a cursed family possesses neither the sustained bone-chilling intensity of the former nor the sociopolitical dread of the latter. Veering erratically between promising setups and disappointing payoffs, it shifts from something reminiscent of the scary satire of Ira Levin toward the altogether dopier domain of Dennis Wheatley. Ironically, its the very things that Hereditary gets just right that make its clunkier missteps seem so wrong. We start in fine form, with an Ordinary People-style opening that seems to ask: Whats wrong with this picture? Following the death of her mother, Ellen, a secretive woman with private rituals, private friends, artist Annie (Toni Collette) feels her world falling apart. Unable to mourn (Should I be sadder?) and prone to sleepwalking, she pours her troubles into her work, building small-world miniatures that resemble dolls houses designed by Diane Arbus. Its into one of these models that cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelskis camera creeps in the opening sequence, segueing seamlessly into the internecine action, suggesting that everything we see is happening in a weirdly artificial world, constructed by Annies inherited anxieties. That sense of unease grows as Annies family scuttle around the shadows of their haunted home. Her disconnected daughter, Charlie (arresting Broadway star Milly Shapiro), cries out for her grandma, and makes strange clucking sounds while fashioning morbid totems. Husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), has the air of a condemned man as he fields calls from the cemetery about Ellens last resting place. As for teenage son, Peter (Alex Wolff), he just wants to get stoned with his buddies, clearly unable to deal with the unspoken secrets lurking in his familys past (Nobody admits anything theyve done!). And then something happens that turns grief into traumatised terror, reopening old wounds and inviting in new horrors. To reveal specifics would risk spoiling one of the most genuinely alarming sequences Ive seen in recent years  a breathtaking jolt that made me gasp and recoil, intensified by the protracted shell-shocked silence that follows. Its a bravura cinematic coup, setting the scene for a spine-tingling meditation on grief and guilt, our senses sharpened by the promise of further scares. Those familiar with Asters short films The Strange Thing About the Johnsons and Munchausen will be primed for a poisonous dissection of twisted family rituals. Elsewhere, a 90-degree camera-tilt mirrors a memorable moment from Babak Anvaris Under the Shadow, an astute point of reference from another tale of a besieged mother. All the more disappointing, then, that what follows gradually downshifts into generic cliche, abandoning well-mapped psychogeography for psychokinetic silliness and superfluous plot exposition. Plaudits are due to the ensemble cast for maintaining an air of realistic distress and derangement, even as the plot parts company with credibility. Collette is terrific as the tortuously conflicted mother whose performance recalls the intensity of Essie Davis in The Babadook, a superior film to which this clearly owes a debt. Scenes between Collette and Shapiro have rich emotional resonance, while Wolff brings a sense of bewildered anger to the family table, matching Gabriel Byrnes hangdog exasperation. Meanwhile, Ann Dowd, who recently earned an Emmy for TVs The Handmaids Tale, has a tougher time as Joan, a broad-stroke character who appears to have wandered straight off the set of Rosemarys Baby. A groaning atonal soundtrack, full of rising polyphonic crescendos and harsh cuts, provides a heartbeat of horror that pulses through a film that wears its influences on its sleeve. Yet those lured in by the quivering quotes on the posters run the risk of being underwhelmed by Hereditary, which, for all its stylistic strengths and subversive subtexts, scares only sporadically. Oh, and for the record, its William Peter Blattys The Exorcist III (rather than William Friedkins epochal original) that is most clearly evoked in a couple of creepy-crawly scenes."
MSR_Doc6_Hereditary,MSR,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"The only false note in Hereditary which despite the hype is far from the scariest horror film since The Exorcist but may be the most horrifying  comes right at the end. After a climax demented enough to straddle the border between the spine-tingling and the comical, a cover of Joni Mitchells wistful Both Sides Now serenades the closing credits. Being a 30-year-old American, writer and first-time feature director Ari Aster is excused his ignorance of UK novelty hits from almost 40 years ago. After this precociously masterful debut, he could be forgiven almost anything short of genocide. Even so, he probably should have ended with Theres No One Quite Like Grandma by the St Winifreds School Choir. Grandma we love you, grandma we do, as mature readers will recall the opening verse in all its lyrical majesty. Though you may be far away, we think of you. The grandma of Hereditary could hardly be further away since the film opens with her burial. But for a screen absentee she has a powerfully brooding presence that obliges us to think of her more and more. In an unusually candid funeral eulogy, ungrieving daughter Annie Graham (Toni Collette) describes her as difficult and secretive, with a love of private rituals. Later, she frets about not feeling sadder. Had she understood the opaque note she finds in the spiritualism book among the old girls effects  Dont hate me. Our sacrifices will pale in the end next to our rewards  she would have jettisoned that guilt. Although Asters style is determinedly languid as he layers the emotional complexities and scatters ominous narrative threads, he waits until that frantic denouement to knit together, he is swift to establish the familys peculiarity. Annie and her stolid therapist husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) live in a large wooden house with a plethora of atmospherically underlit rooms and a spooky treehouse in the garden, all secluded in lush forestry. Their 18-year-old son Peter (Alex Wolff) is a feckless stoner who should have paid more attention to his classics teachers ruminations on how Sophoclean characters ignore the clues about their impotence in the face of malevolent fate. Their daughter Charlie, 13, is sensationally odd. She snips heads off dead pigeons, fills sketch pads with macabre drawings, makes the clicky tongue noise that becomes such a sinister aural motif and echoes an earlier Toni Collette child from The Sixth Sense by seeing dead people. The casting of Milly Shapiro, fresh from wowing Broadway as Matilda, was as inspired as the make-up artists work. Charlies face, at once little girlish and as ancient as an Inca stone carving, is the creepiest element in a very crowded field. Shapiro lands an unlikely double herself, making the unsmiling, barely speaking Charlie sympathetic as well as massively offputting. As ghoulishly isolated as the house is, its inhabitants are more so. Annie, an artist, closets herself away constructing the dolls houses in which she recreates scenes from her life in perfectionist detail, in a pitiably futile effort to impose some kind of order on a life about to veer wildly out of control. Without giving too much away, let it suffice that badgering an unwilling late- teenage son to take his unsociable kid sister to a party is something about which the concerned parent may want to think twice. The results are horrific, emotionally and aesthetically, and launch a corkscrew spin towards hell. Hand on heart (literally: I was checking for fear-induced, chest-thumping tachycardia), at no moment was I terrified. But terror and horror are different beasts, and Hereditary is unforgettably horrifying. While the calamities that befall the Grahams throw up (as you may be tempted to do by the one involving ants) some gloriously gruesome shots, Aster uses them to address two of the grander questions. One stretches back beyond even Sophocles. Is there really such a thing as free will, or are we the playthings of predetermined destiny? The other, almost as modern as DNA science, is whether environment or heredity is the dominant influence. As Annie unwittingly begins unravelling the answers, with help from the seemingly sweet woman (Ann Dowd) she meets at a bereavement support group who encourages her to hold seances, she unravels herself. Collettes portrayal of uncontainable psychic pain, vocally and in the anguishing close-ups that magnify her grief, is staggeringly intense. In one monologue she recounts the gothic horrors her mother inflicted on her father and brother. In others she turns viciously on her son, as if powerless to resist visiting the sins of the mother on herself, telling him she never wanted him and did all she could to miscarry. Despite Collettes unremitting brilliance and Shapiros astonishingly assured screen debut, this is Asters film. The wide range of cinematic influences (most strikingly, Rosemarys Baby) do not compromise the originality of his perspective. As with last years Get Out, which framed an examination of racism within the horror format, he uses the conventions of the genre blood and gore, apparitions  to transcend it. The production notes mention him enduring an unspecified but horrendous sequence of family disasters that left him feeling cursed. But there is no floundering here for cut-price catharsis; no glibly consoling message about therapy or love or art or anything being able to save us if the cosmic dice fall atrociously. On reflection, Doris Days Que Sera, Sera (from Hitchcocks The Man Who Knew Too Much) might have been an even more searingly ironic closing track. Whatever will be will be is the unflinchingly bleak and horrifying truth that helps make Hereditary a bigger and more important film than the hype on the posters suggests."
MSR_Doc7_Hereditary,MSR,Horror,Negative,Hereditary,"To the extent that slow-burn horror movies are about atmosphere, Hereditary has many of them beaten. Using the camerawork of Pawel Pogorzelski and the music of Colin Stetson to fashion the skeleton of a superbly moody background, first-time director Ari Aster hits a home run when it comes to an overall sense of impending doom. Sadly, Asters story isnt as waterproof as his stylistic aptitude. Riddled with logical problems and plagued with a weird wtf? ending (that comes dangerously close to recalling the absurdities of mother!), the narrative skids off the track around the 3/4 mark and never recovers from the derailment. The plot contortions might all make sense during a second viewing but, with its deliberate pace, this isnt a film many people will be in a hurry to revisit. When a movie is established as transpiring in the real world, it is incumbent on the filmmakers to adhere to basic, realistic logic in developing the narrative. For a film with supernatural elements, one expects that ghosts and other paranormal apparitions might be involved  those things are essential to the story. On the other hand, the movie shouldnt shrug off mundane things. If an accident occurs that results in severe injury or death, one expects police involvement. Whats more, this shouldnt just be swept under the rug until it becomes convenient to have a conversation about it. Problems of this nature undermine Hereditarys credibility and damage our ability to take the characters and their situations seriously. The movie focuses on a strange and insular family, the Grahams. At the start of the proceedings, Annie Graham (Toni Collette) is preparing to bury her mother. Her husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), and teenage son, Peter (Alex Wolff), are grave, but neither seems especially upset. The only one broken up about Grandmas death is Charlie (Milly Shapiro), Peters 13-year old sister. Those hoping for a whiff of ghosts or hauntings will have to wait a while. In fact, nothing especially odd happens for about the first hour as the movie toys with our expectations, loads up on claustrophobia and eeriness, and gives us time to get to know the characters as they endure yet another tragedy. For a while, it almost seems like Hereditary is some kind of modern gothic drama, although the characters seem strangely muted and unreal. Its hard to say whether this helps or hurts when things start going bump in the night. Toni Collettes committed performance helps to sell the movie even during its most unconvincing moments. Colette is one of a select number of currently working actresses who can play almost any role in any genre, whether its comedy, drama, or horror. Her face-off with Alex Wolff during the most uncomfortable dinner scene in any recent movie is a testimony to her ability to own the screen. Wolff and Gabriel Byrne are solid, although the script doesnt do them any favors by forcing their characters to react irrationally in both normal and extreme situations. Some (mostly inferior) horror movies thrive on characters doing stupid things; this isnt one of those. Hereditary wants to be taken seriously so when it jettisons real-world concerns to force its otherworldly agenda, it hurts the film. Hereditary is never more than passingly frightening. The jump-scare count is low. However, although the slow-burn approach works well for a while, it ultimately goes on for too long. Momentum flags as the running length approaches (and eventually goes beyond) two hours. I cant go into specifics about why the ending doesnt work without spewing out spoilers (which I wont do) but suffice it to say the change in tone causes whiplash and the level of weirdness throttles the well-modulated, low-key style favored by Aster during the first 110 minutes. Poorly constructed endings can leave an unpleasant aftertaste even for movies that are otherwise mostly solid. Thats the case here."
MSR_Doc8_Hereditary,MSR,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"A great horror movie terrifies you more after you leave the theatre. It imparts a sense of dread that lingers in the mind, longer than any jump scare on the screen. Hereditary is a great horror movie. Ari Asters feature debut, boasting an extraordinary performance by Toni Collette as a mother under siege (remember her at awards time), tracks the course of malign acts visited upon the Graham family, whose members are attempting to live quiet lives in an affluent Pacific Northwest town. The Grahams become innocent targets of evil, but perhaps not unsuspecting ones. When family matriarch Ellen dies at age 78 after a long decline through dementia, her daughter Annie (Collette) strangely eulogizes her as a very secretive woman who would have felt a sense of betrayal to be talked about at a funeral service. Annie doesnt exactly mourn her mothers passing  Should I feel sadder? she asks someone  but she joins a grief support group anyway, befriending a kindly woman named Joan (Ann Dowd). Annie blurts out to the group a history of family tragedy: the suicides of her brother and father, one through hanging and the other through starvation. This traumatic past helps explain Annies unusual occupation: she makes miniature dollhouses and dolls that mimic real-life occurrences and people in the Graham household, including Ellens hospice care prior to her death. Annie evidently seeks to control through her art what she cant control in her life. (These miniature dioramas, which function as both flashbacks and foreshadowing of events in the movie, were crafted by Toronto artist Steve Newburn.) Annies aloof psychotherapist husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) seems of little comfort, caught up in caring for his many patients. The couples teenaged son Peter (Alex Wolff) and 13-year-old daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) have also retreated into their own realms. Their default stares range from indifference to anger. Peter, a quiet stoner, is apparently unruffled by recent events. Charlie, an intense brooder, is quite the opposite. Grandmas death has prompted her to fill a sketchpad with violent drawings and to fashion miniature models out of found objects  including a dead birds head she snaps off with scissors  that signal troubling obsessions. She spends much of her day and most of her nights in a treehouse directly across from the family home. Charlie has the eccentric habit of making a clucking sound that signifies everything and nothing. Its part of the films unsettling sound design, which composer Colin Stetson ratchets up to full creep mode with a soundtrack that freezes the heart. Cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski, meanwhile, moves the camera like a cat stalking its prey, silently gliding through half-lit rooms. It may seem that the Grahams have already endured more than their share of unhappiness. How tragically untrue this proves to be. Writer/director Aster is determined to plunge them into further misery, but he does so with the best of horrific intentions and with a savants taste for cinema  think In the Bedroom, Rosemarys Baby, The Witch and so much more. Asters particular fascination is the quotidian family that hides dark secrets, something readily glommed if you view his 2011 short The Strange Thing About the Johnsons on YouTube. With Hereditary, hes not trying to reinvent the squeal  weve all seen many horror movies about a family battling an indefinable threat. What Aster seeks to do is to transition us from hearth to hell in a manner that will disturb the mind long after the last anguished image flickers from the screen. His success is your nightmare."
MSR_Doc9_Hereditary,MSR,Horror,Negative,Hereditary,"Theres no denying the frequent blunt-force effectiveness of writer-director Ari Asters smugly agitating feature debut, Hereditary, which begins with a showoffy shot that slowly rotates around the studio of professional diorama artist Annie Graham (Toni Collette). The camera eventually pushes into one of Annies models, which imperceptibly becomes a life-size bedroom inhabited by her husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), and their pothead son, Peter (Alex Wolff). This isnt the last time spaces, and the spaces within them, will be utilized in unnerving, disorienting fashion. (Note, for instance, the many establishing shots of the Grahams isolated woodland home that alternate between real-world and miniature exteriors.) Yet the overall effect is gloomy and humorless, as if Aster is doing a stone-faced gloss on the Wes Anderson-parodying SNL skit The Midnight Coterie of Sinister Intruders. Aster is clearly out to mirror his protagonists volatile headspace with such disruptive visuals. Annie is reeling from the death of her mother, whom she never much liked but who still had ahint, hintbewitching effect on the family. Its been barely a week since the womans burial and everyone is still on edge. Annie throws herself into prep for a gallery show and reluctantly attends a grief support group to blow off steam. Steve gets a call from the cemetery where Annies mom is interred and hides some upsetting news from his wife: that the womans grave has been desecrated. And Peter acts the rebelliously dazed and confused adolescent, though theres something amiss in his glazed expression, as if dope isnt the only demon on his shoulder. It certainly would be easiest to blame a Satanic influence for the fateful night when Annie forces Peter to take his sickly, mentally challenged younger sister, Charlie (Milly Shapiro)whose habit of clucking her tongue occasions a few memorable jump scaresto a high school party. Charlie has an allergic reaction after eating a piece of cake with nuts in it. Spaced-out Peter rushes her to his car, hightailing it for a hospital. And then something gruesome occurs that pushes an already troubled brood into a deranged red zone. This section of Hereditary impressively puts any supernatural sturm und drang on the back burner and unflinchingly charts the fraying family bonds. There are a few snake-tongued confrontations between Annie and Peter that are particularly bracing as long-held resentments come to the fore, such as Annies revulsion at ever having children in the first place. Collettes jittery performance is on the fine line between ridiculous and sublime, and shes best suited to these scenes in which the horrors her character faces are of the shadowy variety, the paranormal occurrences seeming to spring from a psychologically tangible and turbulent place. Is Annie actually seeing her dead mother in a dark corner of the room, for example, or is it a mere manifestation of her fractured subconscious? Its best left imprecise. Once it becomes apparent that the Graham family truly is a target of otherworldly malevolence, however, the film loses its menacing power and becomes a monotonous schlockfest. If the images and sounds maintain a baseline competencea dread-inducing hum underscores a number of scenes, and the climax goes inventively topsy-turvy with the laws of gravitythey never seem anything other than derivative. Asters influences are legion, from The Exorcist (an evil spirit literally and figuratively tearing a family apart) to Onibaba (specters hiding near-subliminally in the darkness). But the films patron saint is Roman Polanski, the holy text Rosemarys Baby. A shamelessly shifty Ann Dowd, overdoing the is she or isnt she evil? act as an occult-obsessed acquaintance from Annies therapy group, is essentially Ruth Gordon 2.0. And Hereditarys resoundingly silly conclusion reworks the subtle Mephistophelean poignancy of Rosemarys Babys finale into a shallow, Shyamalan-lite reveal that negates the storys fevered emotional undercurrents. The devil is certainly in these hackneyed details."
MSR_Doc10_Hereditary,MSR,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"Hereditary takes the core haunting element of a spirit with a malevolent agenda and runs with it in a seemingly endless series of unexpected directions over two breathless hours of escalating terror that never slackens for a minute. Arguably the most effective domestic horror chiller since The Conjuring and The Babadook, this A24 release should hit discerning genre fans right where they live. Asters ability to modernize his obvious reverence for the expert mood modulation, visual command and layered characterizations that defined sophisticated horror of the 1960s and 70s catapults the writer-director into the vanguard of contemporary horror auteurs. The films superb cast, led by an astonishingly good Toni Collette, represents another strong draw. Hereditary lifts from an adventurous range of influences that spans from the problem-spawn classic Rosemarys Baby through the malignant mood piece The Shining to the non-horror family grief drama In the Bedroom, with dollops of Greek tragedy and textbook demonology stirred into the mix. It opens with ace cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski (who stands to cop a major career boost with his hypnotic work here) establishing what will be the predominant visual style  unsettlingly slow pans from insidiously strange angles in mostly somber light. At the same time, the near-omnipresent underlay of composer Colin Stetsons rumbling score (which was not the final mix in the Sundance premiere) lays the ominous foundations for the symphony of churning dread to come. The film was shot in Utah but is set in an unnamed non-urban area resembling the Pacific Northwest, mostly around the architecturally imposing home of the Graham family, a spacious, cathedral-like wooden sanctuary with stained-glass windows, nestled in thick forest. Directly out front is an elevated treehouse to which restless youngest child Charlie (Milly Shapiro) frequently retreats in the middle of the night. Within the main house is a whole other world of architectural marvels, minutely detailed miniature homes and rooms in various stages of assembly in the workshop of Charlies mother Annie (Collette), a mixed-media artist preparing for an upcoming gallery show. Those models (Steve Newburn did the amazing miniature designs), as well as the treehouse, will take on disturbing significance as the story progresses. In her eulogy at Ellens funeral, Annie declares her love for her mother but openly acknowledges that she was a difficult woman, private and secretive. It does feel weird, she confesses to her soft-spoken husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) as they return home. Should I be sadder? She checks in on her eldest teenager Peter (Alex Wolff), an easygoing stoner, to see if the funeral upset him and gets an untroubled smile in response. Only Charlie, a brooding 13-year-old with a rats nest of hair and a sketchpad full of angry drawings (even her bunnies and chickens look evil) seems disturbed by Grandmas passing. While Annie is glancing through boxes of her mothers belongings, she comes across a note tucked into a book on spiritualism. Dont hate me, reads its cryptic message. Our sacrifices will pale in the end next to our rewards. That and a hazy apparition of Ellen set off Annies shivers. We learn more about Grandmas dark side when Annie visits a grief support group, spilling out details of her psychotically depressed fathers suicide by starvation and her schizophrenic older brother hanging himself, leaving a note accusing their mother of putting people inside him. Annie reveals that they were estranged for many years, but her mother moved in with them toward the end when she was suffering from dementia. Meanwhile, Steve gets a call from the cemetery informing him that Ellens grave has been desecrated, news he decides to keep from Annie, while creepy Charlie keeps busy with craft projects, little effigies constructed out of what appear to be Grandmas spectacles and pill bottles. Cute. She calmly pulls out her scissors to snip off the head of a pigeon that slammed into her classroom window, and seems unfazed when she sees Grandma sitting amid flames in a field near the house. All this  which is pretty much just the setup  might sound like the arch underpinnings of a standard frightfest about a family in the grip of supernatural peril from the pissed-off departed. But Aster and the actors treat it all with persuasive seriousness, albeit with the occasional touch of mischievous gallows humor. Its evident from the flickers of light dancing around the girl that Grandma has something worrying in mind for Charlie. Annie earlier explained that she kept Peter from her mother while he was a child, but weakened and allowed Ellen to get her hooks into her daughter. Just how deep those hooks have been sunk is revealed in a tragedy that does not take the expected route. That incident rattles the Grahams beyond repair, and while Steve attempts to remain a voice of reason, Annie is so spooked she starts making meticulous miniature recreations of the familys misfortunes in her workshop, not to mention her nighttime treehouse forays. Peter also is profoundly affected, taking a while to snap out of catatonic shock and then subject to strange fits of asphyxiation and violent possession at school. In one of the movies most searing scenes, Annie spews out her bottled-up rage at her son at the dinner table, in a stunning display of wild-eyed hysteria and bitterness from Collette. As if the situation at home isnt hair-raising enough, Ann Dowd then enters the picture. She plays Joan, armed with a smile and words of comfort for Annie as she shares the recent loss of her son and adored 7-year-old grandson. Dowd in benevolent mode is almost scarier than some of her recent monster roles. She keeps popping up in Annies path, introducing her to some basic seance techniques that Annie then impulsively tries at home. Massive mistake. Editors Jennifer Lame and Lucian Johnston keep the pace measured, the transitions smooth and the drama quietly unnerving throughout, supported at every step by Stetsons music. On the visual side, minimal lighting effects are the closest thing to obvious CG work. Likewise the jump scares and other amped-up horror tropes are held back for the final spiral of events, which will scare the bejesus out of all but the most desensitized audiences. Decapitated corpses and barbecued bodies stack up, along with underworld emissaries, witchy symbols and mystic words scrawled on walls, and alarming visual statements of intent manifesting spontaneously on the pages of Charlies sketchpad. But even as Aster soars into Grand Guignol territory, Hereditary keeps a tight hold on its story sense. What makes the movie so satisfying is that while it turns steadily into a batshit-crazy collision of the supernatural and the classically mythological, the family dynamic remains firmly in play. Byrne has the most subdued role, but he deftly conveys the mounting anxiety of a man of reason struggling to manage his wifes rocketing hysteria. Wolff handles the transition from mellow youth into cursed target with aching fragility, Peters disturbing issues with his mother emerging in prickly moments along the way. And Shapiro, one of the original stars of Matilda on Broadway, plays an unsettling character with such a nightmarish trajectory that one hopes her parents will persuade her to wait a few years before watching. The magnificent Dowd continues to add to her formidable gallery of uniquely sinister figures. (Note to self: If you see her, run.) But the riveting center is Collette. The Australian actors emotionally frayed work in one of the most iconic horror movies of the past 20 years, The Sixth Sense, was largely overlooked in favor of Haley Joel Osment seeing dead people. Her performance here is almost operatic in its whiplash turns and fierce thunder crashes of fear and madness. Hereditary doubtless will never reach the stratospheric commercial heights of the M. Night Shyamalan film, but its an immaculately crafted, black-hearted horror-in-the-home fantasia that, like its director, is destined to make a mark."
GDO_Doc1_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,GDO,Action,Positive,James Bond Casino Royale,"Sometimes a film speaks most clearly in what it doesn't bother to say. One such occasion is the opening scene of Casino Royale, in which James Bond confronts a turncoat within British intelligence. Bond is played by Daniel Craig in his rookie outing, and he is played, appropriately enough, as a rookie agent, or at least as one who has not yet been granted his iconic label, ""007."" To ascend to that rank, we are told, requires two sanctioned kills--one, evidently, for each ""oh."" His first was the man who led him to the turncoat, and it was not a pretty one: Bond beat him bloodily before drowning him in the sink of a public restroom. ""Made you feel it, didn't he?"" the turncoat asks. ""Well you needn't worry, the second is--."" Rather than complete the thought, he fulfills it, as Bond casually shoots him through the chest before concurring: ""Yes, considerably."" The word that neither man utters, of course, is ""easier,"" and its elision is telling. This is the first Bond movie in decades, perhaps ever, that respects its audience enough to let them fill in the trope for themselves.
From its first frames, Casino Royale, just released on video, promises to restore the trimmed-down urgency of the early Sean Connery outings as Bond, before the franchise grew so fat and tired and stupid: The MGM lion and the Columbia Pictures torch-lady are both presented in black and white; when onscreen type announces that the first scene is set in Prague, there's a knowing pause, as if to hint this could be some Cold War-era John le Carr adaptation (The Spy Who Loved to Come in from the Cold?), before it confesses its era with ""Czech Republic."" But Casino Royale exceeds this promise, presenting a Bond both leaner and meaner than any that has come before. That this is the best Bond flick in nearly four decades is beyond reasonable dispute; whether it's better even than the early Connerys is a subject worthy of debate.
 
Who could have imagined that the franchise could lift itself up so quickly from the laughable depths of Die Another Day, with its invisible cars and one-man war against the North Korean Army? Though Casino Royale was produced by the same folks responsible for that self-parodying rubbish, it feels as though the rights to the story somehow fell into the hands of an outsider, who fashioned the film as a ""fuck you"" to Bond's official custodians. Rebukes to the franchise's errors and excesses are everywhere: an opening action sequence that consists merely (but marvelously) of two men chasing one another on foot through a construction site; Bond's joke to his female partner that her cover-name is ""Miss Stephanie Broadchest""; the villain's explanation, ""I never understood all these elaborate tortures,"" before he pummels Bond's privates with a knotted rope; Bond's response, when asked whether he'd like his martini shaken or stirred: ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" It is an almost inexpressible relief that the niftiest spy gadget in the entire film is the medical kit hidden in Bond's car.
Unlike recent Bonds, whose kills had no more weight than the one-liners that generally accompanied them, Craig's tend to be intimate, bloody, and devoid of glamour: the restroom murder that opens the movie; a slow, painful strangulation in the bottom of a stairwell. In the latter half of the movie alone, Craig goes through more tuxedo shirts--gore-soaked, waterlogged, shredded--than Roger Moore seemed to dirty during his entire Bond tenure.
Craig is also the first Bond who is not openly pleasure-seeking, whose sexual escapades are clearly intended to further his mission, rather than the other way around. This correction is made most explicit when Bond engages in some light foreplay with a Bahamian lovely in order to find out what her villainous husband might be up to. ""Apparently, he's on the last flight to Miami,"" she informs him between nibbles, ""so you have all night to question me."" In response, Bond phones room service to send up a little beluga and bubbly. But when he's asked ""For two, sir?"" his reply is terse: ""No, one."" Cut to him speeding to the airport. The last several Bonds would probably have let it wait 'til morning; even Connery would at least have allowed himself a wistful sigh at his coital self-sacrifice. It's as if the franchise at last felt forced to decide between carnal vocations for its hero and opted, wisely, for assassin over gigolo. Even the opening credits forsake the tease of quasi-naked jiggle bunnies in favor of a neatly stylized series of animated executions.
And Craig makes a superb assassin. It's not just that he seems more likely to have killed someone than any of his smirking predecessors; it's that he seems likely to have killed them with his forehead. Though a handsome actor (and, according to a disconcerting number of female friends, the sexiest man on the big screen in ages), Craig has not a whiff of prettiness to him. His face is angular but unlovely: the mouth a little wide, the brow a little heavy, the eyes tilting down morosely at the sides. He's the first Bond one doesn't envision spending a great deal of time in front of the mirror. (The gym is another matter: He's so lean you could use him to cut vegetables.)
The film does let down Craig's performance (and viewers) here and there. The plot meanders a bit before arriving at its titular destination: a high-stakes poker game pitting Bond against Le Chiffre (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen), a man who is described as the ""private banker to the world's terrorists,"" and who, like the statue of a medieval saint, weeps tears of blood. The game itself is staged rather inertly (and, according to those who know something about cards, ridiculously). And the movie's denouement suffers a bit from Return of the Kingitis: You think it's over several times before it actually is. But given the revelatory improvement over the last dozen-plus Bond outings, these are quibbles.
Regarding Bond's love interest, a heretically fetching accountant named Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), the film reaches high but falls a little short. It's certainly nice to see Bond's custodians strive for a genuine romance, a sharp sparring between attracted minds (and, yes, not only minds). But the chemistry between Craig and Green is never much in evidence, their repartee isn't quite so clever as the filmmakers think, and her eventual surrender (whatever its explanation) is too abrupt and too complete to be satisfying.
This is the second film in which 007 has fallen truly in love, and the second time that love was doomed. The first was On Her Majesty's Secret Service, starring another freshman Bond--Aussie model George Lazenby, who took over from Connery in 1969 but never made it to a sophomore outing. Like Casino Royale, it too followed Ian Fleming's novel relatively closely, downplayed gadgetry in favor of dramatic depth, and served as a kind of explanation for Bond's darker treatment of the fairer sex. Despite a somewhat leaden performance by Lazenby, it's among the best of the Bond films (thanks, largely, to the magnificent Diana Rigg, the Bond Girl against whom all others must be measured), and it might have offered a model for reinvigorating the franchise. Instead, it was followed by Diamond's Are Forever, a lamely semi-comic, gizmo-stuffed entry that foreshadowed the disappointing decades to come.
There's no real reason to expect that Casino Royale will have a similar one-and-done quality. The fact that it has been widely described as a ""reboot"" suggests at least some awareness by the producers that the franchise had crashed; and Daniel Craig's decision to return for another tour is good news indeed. Still, in mass-market filmmaking it's often easier to throw in a space-based laser than a good line of dialogue, and it's an open question how long the franchise will be able to resist such temptations. But for now, Bond fans have--for the first time in a long, long time--something to savor."
GDO_Doc2_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,GDO,Action,Positive,James Bond Casino Royale,"Daniel Craig enters the picture as Casino Royale comes along at a much-needed time in 2006 to reboot James Bond for the 21st century.
The road leading up to Casino Royale is a blockbuster documentary in and of itself. However, this is another story for another day. In the decade leading up to the film, the Bond franchise was geared more towards fantasy than being grounded in reality. What else could you do after Die Another Day? Listen, I like Pierce Brosnan and his contract was over. Moreover, his final film did to the franchise what Batman and Robin did for the Dark Knight. You can make the argument that they were at rock bottom and needed to do something.
With the rights to Casino Royale back under the fold, it was time to just bring things back to the beginning and give the James Bond franchise a fresh start. This was a risk for the studio and producers but it was the right time for the franchise. In doing so, they honor everyone that came beforehand and finally brought justice to Ian Flemings book in a way that the 1967 spoof never could.
The casting for this film is absolutely perfect. Sure, there was some initial scrutiny when it came to casting Daniel Craig. His rugged look and blonde hair didnt mesh with the five actors who preceded him in the role. Craigs performance harkens back to Timothy Daltons work on-screen. He plays more to the seriousness of the role than the humor that we saw from the likes of Roger Moore. What he has to do more than the others is take it back to the start of Bonds career. There are always high expectations that come with Bondmaybe more so than with any other franchise because of the history. Craig absolutely delivered in his performanceone of the best of 2006 and Oscar-worthy if you ask me. Fifteen years later, were a day away from the world premiere of Craigs final performance as Bond in No Time to Die.
As Vesper Lynd, Eva Green feels so much different than previous Bond women. Her character doesnt feel like shes there for show. Shes not the type that Bond will just screw around with in other to get information. In the end, of course, she turns out to betray James but she has her own reasoning. Its something that we learn more about during the WGA strike-affected Quantum of Solace. But still, I like how start driving away from the tropes that made the Bond films what they are.
Mads Mikkelsen does justice to the villainous role as Le Chiffre makes his on-screen debut in the Eon productions. When hes torturing Bond following the card game, hes not torturing a stunt double. Hes torturing Craig himself. You can read a lot more about this scene in Nobody Does It Better. But anyway, Mads joins Benicio Del Toro in being the only people to date to appear in the James Bond, Star Wars, and Marvel franchises. A number of actors have appeared in two of the three franchises so well see if this number increases over time.
Musically speaking, David Arnolds fourth Bond score works for the film. Being a veteran of the franchise, he knows what works best for the film and what doesnt. Its an interesting choice to hold off on the classic Bond theme until the end of the film. In its place throughout the film, however, is a recurring motif from the title song, You Know My Name, sung by Chris Cornell. But hey, this also speaks to where Bond is in his career. Hes not the veteran 007 that we know from the previous movies because hes at the start of his career. Look at how M (Judi Dench) treats Bond when he breaks into her place!
I wouldnt change a thing about Casino Royale. It is as perfect as a James Bond film can get for a script based in reality rather than fantasy. Martin Campbell is a Bond veteran as he helped retool the franchise with Pierce Brosnan in GoldenEye. Gone are the gadgets but some of the other classic Bond tropes return. Instead of depending on CGI, they largely focus on practical effects especially during the major set pieces at the Madagascar building site, the Miami International Airport, and the Venetian house sinking. While Bond is in the Bahamas, he wins Alex Dimitrioss (Simon Abkarian) 1964 Aston-Martin DB5, a callback to Goldfinger. Dimitrioss wife, Solange (Caterina Murino), is soon discovered dead.
Casino Royale takes things back to the start for James Bond with a new actor and delivers one of the best films in the franchise."
GDO_Doc3_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,GDO,Action,Positive,James Bond Casino Royale,"Casino Royale saw the debut of both Daniel Craig and his more gritty direction for the franchise, and while his run has seen its ups and downs I can honestly say that Casino Royale is among my favourites of the whole franchise, with its opening 10 minutes being one my favourite openings ever.  Lets take a look!
Synopsis:
After receiving a license to kill, British Secret Service agent James Bond heads to Madagascar, where he uncovers a link to Le Chiffre, a man who finances terrorist organizations. Learning that Le Chiffre plans to raise money in a high-stakes poker game, MI6 sends Bond to play against him, gambling that their newest 00 operative will topple the mans organization
*spoilers appear from here on out!*
The Good:
The first gun barrel sequence!  Of Daniel Craigs run.
As I mentioned in the opening paragraph, the first part of this film is still amongst my favourite things to watch ever. Bond is waiting in the office of a traitor, all silhouetted and in black and white, and the two have a chat about how Bond isnt a double 0 yet because you have to have killed two people. He soon figures out that Bond must of killed his contact, which we then see happen in a rather brutal bathroom brawl, and then says dont worry, it gets- and then Bond shoots him, quips yes, exceptionally then we go back to the bathroom where the contact pick up and gun and then gets shot via the classic gun barrel sequence then we jump into the extremely catching opening theme, which includes a computer readout that says James Bond  00 Status Confirmed. I remember just being blown away at the time, the violence of the brawl and the still suave quippyness of the framing scene made me very excited for this new direction, especially as Die Another Day made me less enthusiastic about the franchise.
Before we get to the casino part of the film we see some backstory as to how it all comes about: Bond tracks a bomb maker to Madagascar and has a frankly still-stunning foot chase with him that ends with an explosion at a local embassy, but does give 007 some ideas as to where to follow some leads, meanwhile were introduced to Le Chiffre (the always excellent Mads Mikkelsen) who takes a large payment from the Ugandan Resistance army and promises to invest it an airplane company that hes set up to have a terrorist attack ruin. Sadly for Le Chiffre Bond catches on to the plan and manages to track down the terrorist and stop the attack on the plane, meaning the terrorist broker now owes some nasty resistance fighters a large sum of money. This is why he organises a stupidly high-stakes poker game in Montenegro with some super-rich underground contacts, allowing MI6 to pick Bond to enter the game as hes the services best poker player, hoping hell bankrupt Le Chiffre and send him running to the British embassy for sanctuary. Bond is joined by attractive treasury agent Vesper Lynd (Evan Green) and Ren Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini), a local contact.
Bond with a beautiful woman, in a tuxedo while holding a gun. That about ticks all of the boxes!
We then get the poker game, which is full of hotel room brawls with resistance fighters, Bond nearly dying of deadly poison but reviving due to a defibrillator and antidote in his car (the only real gadget in the film) and a clear romantic relationship forming between Bond and Vespter, despite Bond normally only being into married women because it makes things less complicated. Bond actually loses due to Le Chiffre faking a tell and Vesper refuses to buy him back in with any more of the governments money but US agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) stakes Bond the money if the US government gets Le Chiffre instead of them. Bond agrees and ends up winning the game with a straight flush but soon Vesper is kidnapped and Bond along with her a few moments later. Le Chiffre tortures Bond for the account number to get his funds back but is killed by Mr. White (Jesper Christensen), his second who as it turns out is actually a member of a mysterious organisation that has been helping Chiffre and now have no more use of him.
Bond wakes up in a hospital and believe Mathis must have betrayed them to Le Chiffre and has him arrested, then transfers the money to the correct account and decides to head off to Venice with Vesper, contemplating leaving MI6 to be with her until a week or two later when M (Judi Dench still, for the record!) phones him and asks where the money is. Bond chases Vesper to a hand-off, causing her to be captured by some gunmen and leading to a shoot-out in a sinking building on the Grand Canal. Bond kills the attackers but Vesper is locked in a lift as the room fills with water, eventually fighting Bonds help and drowning herself while Mr. White walks off with the money. Turns out Vesper was a double agent as her lovers life was being threatened and the final money handover was to save Bonds life and while this news is brushed off by Bond its clear the experience has been a hard one for the agent. The film ends a short while later with Bond shooting Mr. White in the leg at his villa and introducing himself as Bond, James Bond., directly leading into the next film
The Bad:
Le Chiffre isnt impressed although to be fair I dont think he really smiles in his line of work
Very little to dislike about this film, honestly. Its well directed, the action scenes are great, the plot is fun to follow (for a Bond film and therefore not worrying about realism so much) and the actors / actresses all well cast. About the only thing to dislike is that it sets the bar too high, the rest of Craigs era has yet to reach these heights again, in my opinion anyway
Overall Thoughts:
Bond has a fist fight on the top of a crane, as all spies do at some point in their careers.
In case you cant tell by now I love Casino Royale, its right up there with my favourite films, let alone Bond films. Well paced, well shot, well acted and lots of nods to past Bond-isms but done in a fun and often clever this is the start of his career way. One of the best of the Bonds, and definitely Craigs best well, with one film left to come, anyway!"
GDO_Doc4_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,GDO,Action,Positive,James Bond Casino Royale,"This was the basis for how Casino Royale came to be.
Casino Royale was the necessary reboot of Bond and the only way Casino Royale could be fully realised on screen.  Die Another Day disappointed not only critics but also Bond fans alike.  But getting Casino Royale off the ground was not going to be easy, and it stems right back to when the book was first published in 1953.
Ian Fleming always wanted Bond to be adapted for the movies.  Unfortunately the studios could only see Bond as a TV series.  Frustrated, Fleming sold the rights to Casino Royale cheaply which later prevented Broccoli and Saltzman from making it the first Bond feature film (Dr. No became the first instead).  What came out of this was a TV adaptation where James Bond was renamed as Jimmy Bond for the American audiences.  Its interesting that Joe Don Bakers character in Goldeneye (Jack Wade) calls Bond Jimmy or Jimbo  American slang for James, but it can also be viewed as an obvious reference to the past.  In 1967, a spoof version starring Woody Allen, David Niven and Peter Sellers followed where there were multiple Bonds in one film. In fact the rights to Casino Royale have been passed around (like tic tacs) so many times, that each attempted adaptation forgot the key ingredient  including the actual James Bond in his integral form!  Its no wonder Fleming was horrified but worse was yet to come.
After Kevin McClory won his court case over the rights of Thunderball, it gave him a certain privilege to start his own rival Bond film after a certain number of years.  This spawned Never Say Never Again in 1983 but he also tried to negotiate rights with Columbia Pictures for Casino Royale.  At the same time Sony was trying to negotiate the rights of Spider-Man off MGM/UA in exchange for Casino Royale.  Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson had to fight back and it was only due to McClorys no show in court due a visa problem that the rights for Casino Royale was finally back in the hands of EON and the Broccoli family.  And thank God for that because Casino Royale is one of the best Bond films ever  period.
The success of Casino Royale really stems from two things  a faithful adaptation of Flemings most famous novel (while updating it to the modern world) and rebooting Bond with Daniel Craig.
I remember when Daniel Craig was announced as Bond and the amount of negative vitriol aimed at him.  It was totally uncalled for.  I just kept thinking lets see what he can do before we judge him but even Sam Mendes, director of Skyfall admitted at the time that he thought it was a terrible idea (Everything or Nothing documentary, 2012).  But I can see why Barbara fought very hard for Daniel Craig.  While it must have been difficult to drop Pierce Brosnan (it wasnt his fault why his last film was so sh*t) but the change was necessary.  If Craigs performance in Layer Cake (which is a brilliant film btw) was any indication that he could be Bond, Craig possesses the characteristics that would take Bond into the new world and new era.  Barbara Broccoli believed this and Craig went on to prove his critics wrong with an absolutely tremendous performance.  I hope those idiots at danielcraigisnotbond.com are weeping right now

What makes Craigs performance so good is for the first time (in a long time) we got to see an emotional side to Bond.
The beginning of Casino Royale easily establishes what we already know (or should know) about Bond  hes a cold killer spy.  The opening scenes shot beautifully in black and white shows Bond at his deadliest and brutal best.  We see Bond bleed, bruised and battered after fights.  We see him in peril and tortured.  He bulldozes his way from situation to situation (e.g. the awesome parkour chase) without care.  Only his ego and his drive motivate him to get the job done.  Hes a blunt instrument as M would say.  This is Bond going back to his roots.
It is around halfway through the film with the introduction of Vesper Lynd where Bond really comes alive and we see a different side of him  something that has rarely been explored in the previous films.  The first scene shared between Bond and Vesper is the best dialogue Ive heard in ANY Bond film.  It starts off as flirtatious banter as they size each other up.  Its like watching a married couple!  When the poker game is in full swing and Bond faces the endless twists and turns, we see how others perceive his brutality as an agent for her majestys government.  Vesper becomes a firsthand witness to what kind of world Bond lives in.  Traumatised and in shock, she sits alone in the shower, letting the water wash off the memory (or maybe realising what she had let herself in for with her own motives).  Realising this, Bond comforts her.  This was the moment where Bond doesnt think about missions or getting the job done.  This was the moment Bond fell in love with Vesper and vice versa.  Two characters broken by their past, vulnerably finding each other to be the emotional crutch they needed to survive.
Vesper is a complicated woman and probably why she is my favourite Bond girl of all time.  Smart, sophisticated and beautiful, she certainly matches Bond in terms of his humour, charm and devotion.  While her own motives were kept hidden, falling in love with Bond was probably not part of her plans.  But she did. She watches Bond confess his love and give up the spy life just for her, something that must have taken her by surprise.  So to see her break his heart and betray him after all they had been through is heart-breaking.  Obviously she never intended for him to get hurt, sparing his life from ball breaker Le Chiffres torture.  No matter how much we will this relationship on, it feels that Vesper and Bonds love affair was doomed from the start and thats why it will always feel tragic.  Killing herself spares her the lifetime of guilt and pain but desperately separates her from the one man who got her, the one man who still fought for her, despite her deception.
In all the Bond movies, this is the most emotional and personal Bond adventure Ive seen and kudos to Daniel Craig and Eva Green for making this work.
Casino Royale works because it highlights that James Bond is a tortured soul, just how Fleming intended.  Like On Her Majestys Secret Service, it robs Bond of a happy ending but reminds the audience that there are no happy endings in Bonds world.  Unlike OHMSS where Teresas death robbed Bond of a new life (committed by outside forces), Bond was deceived by the one he loved.  Its a death that is hard to take. Bond seemed to be growing up because he has always thought of women as disposable pleasures.  You genuinely feel sorry for him.  As much as Vesper was herself a pawn in the organisations game (later to be known as Quantum), it is the unseen enemies, the ones who we turn a blind eye to that sets us up for failure and pain.  Bond learnt the hard way and it sets up Quantum of Solace so perfectly.  Craig gives Bond a hidden emotional depth  every punch, every kill, every secret and lies hurts him.  Its no wonder why he has quickly elevated as the best Bond ever.
The poker scenes are filled with edge of your seat tension with Mathis constantly reminding the audience how much money is in the pot or what cards are needed to win the game.  Mads Mikkelsen is brilliant as Le Chiffre.  Its nice to see a villain for a change under pressure throughout rather than a villain who is constantly in control and having the upper hand on everyone else.  The more Le Chiffre is under pressure to win the money back for his expensive (and pissed off) clients, the more extreme his lengths would go.  Composer David Arnold evokes the spirit of John Barry with his best film score for Bond.
But most importantly for Casino Royale, it brings back respect to James Bond and the entire franchise.  It really saves it.  If people thought Die Another Day would be the death of Bond, Casino Royale was Bond reborn.
While Fleming may have been horrified at the early attempts of Casino Royale, I hope somewhere up there, he is proud of this adaptation."
GDO_Doc5_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,GDO,Action,Positive,James Bond Casino Royale,"15 years ago today (16th November, 2021), the 21st James Bond film, Casino Royale, was released in UK cinemas: it earned rave reviews, became the franchise's highest-grossing entry at that point and eliminated any negative pre-publicity that had surrounded Daniel Craig's casting with the same kind of ruthless efficiency that his newly-minted agent 007 was immediately seen to display on-screen.
A decade-and-a-half later, the release of No Time to Die in late September drew to a close Craig's five-film era as Bond  a tenure which saw the film series rebuke the critics once again and reestablish itself as a major player in the world of modern blockbuster cinema. But when the time comes for producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson to take stock and consider where Bond should go next, they'd be wise to reflect on past successes and, specifically, to consider what it was about Casino Royale that worked so well.
Now, this isn't a rallying cry to simply ""do Casino Royale again""  in fact, the biggest mistake that Bond 26 could make would be to replicate the look and feel of the Daniel Craig movies, successful though they might've been. Instead, what the next 007 movie needs to mimic is the 2006 film's spirit of reinvention  in short, it needs to be as different from Casino Royale as Casino Royale was from Pierce Brosnan's final hurrah, 2002's extremely mixed bag Die Another Day.
It's easy to forget 15 years on how daring Casino Royale felt at the time, especially since the Daniel Craig era has since made subverting expectations and daring to go to places the franchise previously never would its stock in trade, culminating  perhaps inevitably  in the actual, not-fooling-honest death of James Bond. Looking to reimagine the 44-year-old series like never before, Broccoli, Wilson, director Martin Campbell (who'd previously relaunched Bond to great success, though in less subversive style, with 1995's Goldeneye) and screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis ditched much of what was familiar and what might at one time have been considered sacrosanct.
Fronted by a steely but sympathetic Craig, who was ably supported by a sensational turn from Eva Green and the absolutely magnetic Mads Mikkelsen, the film loosely adapts Ian Fleming's story of Bond looking to financially cripple Le Chiffre  an enemy agent who is bankrolling terrorists  over a game of cards, only for the situation to spiral wildly out of control as 007 is hit by a betrayal he never saw coming.
Casino Royale was like nothing the series had offered us before  yes, gone were the gadgets and quips, but Bond had been here before, adopting a similar back-to-basics approach in the late 1980s when the tongue-in-cheek theatrics of the Roger Moore films gave way to a more sober portrayal of 007's world in two films starring Timothy Dalton. More striking even than the shift in tone was the ease with which Casino Royale did away with the opening gun-barrel sequence (at least in its traditional form), the brilliant inventor Q, Moneypenny and her playful relationship with Bond... you suspect even M might have been ditched if they (and audiences) weren't so fond of Judi Dench  and it's credit to the quality of the final product that not only did it wow critics and long-time Bond fans regardless but that it felt unquestionably Bondian despite the lack of those ingredients once thought untouchable and absolutely essential to the franchise formula.
This willingness to be bold and audacious is what the next film would do well to lift from Casino Royale. The 007 films have always thrived on reinvention  the Sean Connery films evolved from Cold War era spy thrillers to wild spy-fi blockbusters, Roger Moore took Bond intergalactic amidst the Star Wars fever of the 1970s, with Timothy Dalton then bringing the character quite literally back down to Earth, while Pierce Brosnan ran the gamut from more personal, human stories to utterly outlandish action capers (and that was just in Die Another Day)  but Daniel Craig's first outing is perhaps the purest example of Bond being willing to strip the character to his bare bones and then rebuild in a way that works for modern audiences  and, crucially, the actor playing Bond.
The temptation given the enormous critical and box office success of the Craig movies might be to simply produce a Craig-type movie but with a different actor  but to do so would be to ignore the best thing about Casino Royale and what allowed it and Craig to succeed. Give whoever picks up the baton next their own kind of Bond movie, let it reflect their strengths as a performer as Casino did Craig's. Do that and we'd bet big on Bond's next 15 years being every bit as bright as the last."
GDO_Doc6_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,GDO,Action,Negative,James Bond Casino Royale,"In the new film, the first version of Flemings Casino Royale (the 1967 film, with David Niven and a host of others, was a spoof), Bond (Daniel Craig) has only recently gained his license to kill, by murdering his second victim (whose violent death in a public bathroom we witness during the pre-credits). Then, inexplicably, Bond is on the trail of a bombmaker in Madagascar. An extended chase ensues, followed by an explosion. Contrary to instructions, Bond heads for the Bahamas and eventually Miami, where he foils a plot to blow up a new jetliner.
Meanwhile, Le Chiffre (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen), who, naturally, is a banker for terrorists in Campbells film, has invested $100 million for an African terrorist on the assumption that the jetliner will be blown up and its manufacturer ruined. Now his angry clients want their money back, and he plans to win it back playing baccarat at a casino in Montenegro. Bond is supplied with $10 million of the British governments money, and an assistant, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), in an effort to foil him.
If Bond films indicate something about the mood of those who commission, organize and shoot them (and perhaps wider circles than that), what does Casino Royale tell us? At the time of Daniel Craigs hiring as Bond (following Connery, Roger Moore, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan), director Campbell promised something definitely darker, more character, less gadgets.
There are fewer weapons and explosions in Campbells work (although the lengthy chase scenes are tedious), and the mood is definitely more somber. The film is oddly spasmodic, fragmented and without any real center, geographical or moral. The headquarters of Bonds agency, which played a considerable and reassuring role in many of the early films, is gone, replaced by an anonymous apartment (belonging to M [Judi Dench], Bonds boss) in Londons Canary Wharf district. The villains are not terrorists in any meaningful political sensein fact, its entirely unclear who and what they are. The leading participants in the events of the films last few minutes are virtually unknown to us, and die or disappear before they make their presence felt dramatically.
The tone and rhythm of Casino Royale are deeply inconsistent. Not certain in which direction to proceed, the filmmakers, one senses, try various approaches. Scenes of genuinely sadistic, realistic violence alternate with idyllic sequences set in the Bahamas, Italys Lake Como, Venice and various locales in the Czech Republic (which for some reason stands in for Montenegro) and efforts at creating character.
The relationship between Bond and Vesper is accorded a few minutes. While we are told they are mad for each other, little of the emotional or physical chemistry that would convince us makes its way to the screen. And Green and Craig are burdened, more or less out of the blue, with lines like this: If the only thing left of you was your smile and your little finger, youd still be more of a man than anyone Ive ever met and I have no armour left. Youve stripped it from me. Whatever is left of mewhatever I amIm yours.
Aside from a few moments reclining with Vesper, Bond here is oddly machine-like, almost robotic. He moves rapidly, hurling himself from one point to the next. Connerys Bond had some of the swaggering, almost lazy self-assurance of the Cold War democracies; Crag is nervous, unhappy, isolated. Some of this feels appropriate to the historical moment, but the psychological changes in the character have not been worked through; they seem to have evolved more or less arbitrarily and accidentally.
The sadistic violence is troubling. Here too the filmmakers, albeit unconsciously, are attuned to the dark and frustrated moods of certain social layers. The film opens with Bond beating a man half to death and nearly concludes with his own brutal torture. The early Bond films, including their fight scenes, were utterly unreal and artificial, quasi-comical. In essence, very little of that unreality has been addressed in the new Casino Royale (the politics are far more skewed and fanciful, in fact), except in the increased intensity and duration of the violence. Whereas events, including the love story, generally proceed rather quickly, the filmmakers slow down to devote a considerable amount of time, lovingly, to the torture scene in particular, during which Bond is strapped naked to a chair. There is nothing healthy in that.
It is especially ironic that the terrorists, or at least their agent, should be carrying out acts of sexual torture. As we know, the American and British military and intelligence forces, and their allies, are the leading experts in this field. In the end, this is what makes a realistic Bond an oxymoron. Insofar as a Bond film comes into contact with social and historical facts, it must turn them on their head, losing any of its charm in the process.
Aside from a few entertaining and adventurous moments, and the lovely settings, there is very little to Casino Royale. And what there is, disturbs."
GDO_Doc7_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,GDO,Action,Negative,James Bond Casino Royale,"The introduction of a new James Bond always brings skepticism, and one of the major problems of Bond's 21st official cinematic adventure is that the skepticism remains when the final credits roll. Some will pick on the easy target: Daniel Craig, the new physical incarnation of Bond. Craig, a blond-haired, blue-eyed Brit, is not the type we typically associate with 007, and backlash against his casting sprang immediately upon his connection to the role. Honestly, it's petty, since it's what he does with role that's important, not how he looks. Craig is actually a great choice for the new Bond persona of Casino Royale; it's the new spin on the character from screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis that leaves doubts. Their Bond is more low-rent thug than suave cosmopolitanmore government assassin than super spy. He is, essentially, without personality, and it is to Craig's credit that he tries his best to instill some charm into a charmless role. Since the movie is an obvious attempt to restart the franchise from the beginning (actually using Ian Fleming's first Bond novel as its inspiration) and the character is just starting to develop, the decision makes sense, but the movie suffers because of it nonetheless.

The movie opens with Bond acquiring his ""00"" status by killing two men. Somewhere in Africa, a man with one useful eye named Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) takes some money from so-called freedom fighters. Bond, meanwhile, is in Madagascar, tracking down terrorist Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) to retrieve information from him. After an extended chase that leads him to kill Mollaka and blow up part of a foreign embassy, Bond is obviously not on MI6 leader M's (Judi Dench) best side. Bond decides to decipher information retrieved from the terrorist on his own and makes his way to the Bahamas as a rogue agent. There Bond finds Alex Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian), who helps with the execution of terrorist activities, and his wife Solange (Caterina Murino).. After some wooing of Solange, Bond discovers Dimitrios' plans involving the destruction of a new jet airliner in Miami. That plan, of course, is thwarted by 007, and Bond is back slightly on M's good side, leading her to let him join a high-stakes, no-limit hold-'em poker game run by Le Chiffre at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. The catch: Bond must answer to the Treasury Department's liaison Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).

Clearly, a lot is happening in the plot, and as per usual, most of it makes little to no sense. Occasionally, the script's weaving and winding, double-cross-filled plot is frustrating and sloppy, especially when Bond seems to have an extrasensory knowledge of who the real villains are before any evidence arises. A good chunk of the story revolves around the poker game, and director Martin Campbell never achieves any worthwhile tension in these scenes. There's one of the movie's four action sequences, a chase in a stairwell, randomly thrown in the middle of the poker plot to spice things up, but it feels forced. The other action sequences fare much better. Instead of the gadget-heavy, exaggerated action to which we've become accustomed, the sequences here are based slightly more in reality. The lengthy chase in Madagascar succeeds the most, with Bond and Mollaka running and climbing up the steel of a construction site. Another has Bond hanging on for dear life to a truck rigged to explode as a terrorist attempts to knock him off. The climax is a shoot-out in a building collapsing into the canals of Venice, which provides an added dynamic to what could be pretty standard stuff.

Other than the story's weak points, there's also the problem that, while Le Chiffre has a creepy gimmick in the form of tear ducts that bleed, Bond's arch-nemesis finds himself at the mercy of other, lesser characters more than once. He's a generic villain and, at best, a mild threat to our hero. One distressing scene has Le Chiffre torturing Bond (it involves a nude Bond, strapped to a chair with no bottom, and a length of rope), and while it gives the villain a bit more menace, the scene is more intriguing for the fact that Bond shows inklings of masochism. The notion is one of the better character moments for a Bond who hardly talks, especially early in the movie, and it gives Craig one of many chances to allude to Bond's darker side. This brooding Bond is sometimes refreshing, but there might be too much of it here. It's a wise move to show Bond in love here to balance his character, and Eva Green is positively stunning in the role. Throughout the course of the movie, there are hints of the charismatic character we've become used to, but by the end, Bond seems to be on his way to a permanent stay in the shadows of his pain.

Where this new vision of the series is heading could have promise, and it's good this is not a prequel. A character like Bond should already be pretty well-defined after 20 movies, and an origin story is almost a trivial exercise, really. It doesn't have to be, of course, but that's what Casino Royale ultimately feels like."
GDO_Doc8_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,GDO,Action,Negative,James Bond Casino Royale,"After the lackluster previous three Bond entries starring Brosnan, I had high hopes for the new Casino Royale because it was being billed as a ""grittier"" Bond film, and the last two times Bond ""returned to basics,"" it resulted in what are possibly my two favorites of the entire series, 1989's Licence to Kill and 1981's For Your Eyes Only.  Furthermore, Casino Royale had Martin Campbell returning to direct, and in my estimation, his first Bond film, Goldeneye, was the last enjoyable entry in the series.
Campbell's Casino Royale is indeed grittier, but unfortunately, it's only marginally better than the last three.  Unlike Licence to Kill and For Your Eyes Only, I think filmmakers got a little too down to earth for their own good this time, and, in turn, squeezed out a lot what's fun about these movies.  Licence to Kill and For Your Eyes Only had just the right balance of grit, wit and spectacular action.  The latest Bond, however, is overlong (its 144 minutes makes it the longest Bond to date), often sluggish and lacking in the kind of big, exciting action we've come to expect in Bond movies.
But on the plus side, Casino Royale contains no digital effects, which is refreshing after the previous two Bonds became overwhelmed with digital effects.
For those who thought Timothy Dalton's demeanor was too serious as Bond (I thought Dalton was just right for the role), Dalton is practically Roger Moore as compared to the latest Bond, blond-haired, blue-eyed Daniel Craig (Layer Cake, Infamous), who plays the role with a stone-faced intensity more reminiscent of Charles Bronson.  Craig, though, isn't the problem.  The problem is that he's the centerpiece of an inconsistently paced film that goes on way too long and doesn't have enough action or suspense.
Furthermore, the latest Bond theme song, ""You Know My Name"" by Chris Cornell, may very well be the most instantly forgettable in series history.
Since this is based on Fleming's first Bond novel, Casino Royale, like Batman Begins, is a return to the origins of the character in an attempt to revitalize a creaky franchise.  In the film, Craig's Bond has just recently been made a double 00 agent by his superior M (Judi Dench) and 007s first assignment is to neutralize a money launderer for terrorists named Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen).  Bond's mission takes him from Uganda to the Bahamas to Miami to the Balkan States to Venice as he tracks the one-eyed, asthmatic, and, of course, sadistic Le Chiffre.
After joining forces with a fellow British agent (and eventual love interest) named Vesper Lynd (Eva Green of Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers), Bond and Le Chiffre finally come face to face during an international poker game where the British government stakes Bond in an attempt to bankrupt Le Chiffre by having Bond beat him at the gambling table.  This is also where Bond first meets his future long term CIA friend and contact Felix Leiter (played here by Jeffrey Wright) and gets introduced to what will become his signature drink, a martini, shaken not stirred.
It not until the very end that we first hear 007 utter his famous, ""Bond, James Bond"" line, and not until the end credits that we hear Bond's famous theme music.
Casino Royale has a couple of decent chase sequences, and Craig does have a strong screen presence, but just like the Cornell's theme song, most of what happens is instantly forgettable and nothing we haven't seen before.
From the results of EONs last four Bond films, this is clearly a worn-out franchise ready to be put out to pasture.  The man with the license to kill has become the man with the license to bore."
GDO_Doc9_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,GDO,Action,Negative,James Bond Casino Royale,"Anyhow, with some of this in mind, I went along to the Odeon Leicester Square on Friday night for the first screening of the new Bond, the Daniel Craig Bond. Most of the other balding, paunchy one-timeschoolboys in the queue seemed to have a similar not quite cynical sense of expectation. There'd be chases, and gadgets and gags - the last Bond line I'd heard in the cinema, was also one of the best: Pierce Brosnan, on the Bosphorus with Dr Christmas Jones at the end of The World is not Enough: 'I've always wanted to have Christmas in Turkey.'
Hopes were high. If nothing else, there would be John Barry's theme, which, as I joined the line to have my mobile phone confiscated - an emasculation I could never imagine 007 submitting to - was already dun-de-dunning in my head. The word before this screening was that Daniel Craig's Bond would be a purist's Bond, dirtier and grittier than recent smoothies. Casino Royale was the first of Fleming's books, and the only one, for contractual reasons, never previously filmed except in the Peter Sellers spoof. It would return James to his roots, the cold-blooded killer, the ex-wartime Commander, before fast women and invisible cars turned his head. It begins, after a title sequence involving the designs on the back of playing cards, and diamonds coming out of guns and writhing croupiers in silhouette - you know - in exactly that retro spirit, apparently in black and white, in Prague: Bond is in the shadows surprising a double agent rifling through a filing cabinet. Craig had effectively auditioned for Bond in Layer Cake, in which he played a cocaine dealer out of his depth, and we cut to what looks like a scene from that film - the very un-Bond-like graphic violence of Craig murdering an informer in a white-tiled public lavatory, holding the man's head underwater in a cheap sink. This, we are led to understand, was Bond's first kill, the most traumatic, his 007 status still pending, before the quips set in. His second, of the double agent by the filing cabinet, with a silencer, is more straightforward, and prompts a wry smile.
That grainy preamble over, Craig is in colour and up and running - straight through a staged cobra and mongoose fight in a market in Madagascar, over the odd trashed car, past plenty of startled villagers carrying unlikely dry goods, up some serious scaffolding scattering hard-hatted building workers, and on to a crane tower over the impossibly blue ocean in pursuit of a scar-faced villain with a bag of explosives. Who wants backstreet grittiness when you can have fights with guns that run out of bullets at opportune moments at high altitude?
Craig is the first Bond since Connery who looks more than capable of doing his own stunts, he runs like a streetfighter, falls credibly from great heights and has been practising his free running. This is pre-Q Bond; the closest he gets to a gadget is a decent mobile phone; he spends a good deal of his time chasing fast cars on foot in a manner Roger Moore would have deemed far too keen; to start with he doesn't even seem to have his own motor. Worse still, he hasn't yet earned Barry's theme, except in odd mangled chords.

The best preface to Casino Royale is Simon Winder's wonderful book The Man Who Saved Britain, out in paperback to coincide with the release of the film. It's the comic history of an obsession with Bond, both his own and our own - an unravelling of all the curious hang-ups about posh drinks and hat-throwing and casual misogyny that takes in the demise of imperial ambition, post-war austerity and Fleming's taste for torture. It's a brilliant deconstruction of those staples of British life that Paul Johnson, writing long ago of Bond in the New Statesmen, denounced as 'sex, snobbery and sadism', (this before Johnson moved to the Spectator and discovered the pleasures of the same).
You rather wish Cubby Broccoli and the rest had studied Winder's memoir before embarking on Casino Royale. One of the things his book argues well is that the explosion of a gas tanker is no real substitute for vaguely plausible plotting or some notion of contemporary relevance - a key element in Fleming's thrillers was his sharp move from villainous former Nazis, to Cold War paranoia.
In attempting to flesh out the idea of Daniel Craig's Bond as backstory to subsequent Bonds - trying on his first dinner jacket for size, tripping over his chat-up lines to Eva Green's gorgeous Vesper Lynd, replying when asked if he wants his martini shaken or stirred, 'Do I look like I give a damn?' - almost everything else seems to have gone out of the window (along with various not particularly sinister villains).
I'm quite happy for Bond to live in a continuous present, but the time frame of the film is perplexing. After the grainy Fifties Prague opening, there is the predictable Seventies, Whicker's World rush of destinations, taking in Uganda, Madagascar, the Bahamas and Venice, while Bond, who we are presumably supposed to believe we have never come across before, suggests from time to time that he is in 2006. Judi Dench as M, seems more than usually unsure about the wisdom of her role or which era she's in. She speaks at one point of her nostalgia for the Cold War, before outlining the plot, such as it is, which involves an attempt to manipulate the stock market using terrorism, bringing in the first and only reference to 9/11. You don't expect Casino Royale to be 24, quite, or Bond to be Jack Bauer, but it seems bizarre to be employing a mix of Albanian and Swiss and African and Italian financial terrorists when you might think there are more real current fears to explore.
Director Martin Campbell is also unsure about how much of the glamour of violence he wants to strip back. There are unusual 007 moments in which Bond lets us know he's human, sitting soaking in the shower in his blood-drenched dinner suit comforting Vesper after she has helped him kill a man; or, oddly, screaming in pain. Raymond Chandler praised the original book of Casino Royale for its brutal description of torture, exposing genre-fiction to a new realism. The scene that Chandler singled out is reproduced here, with Bond tied naked on the frame of a chair while his exposed scrotum is whipped with a knotted rope. Craig is, not surprisingly, in more obvious pain than any previous Bond , but having put him there, the only way to remove him is through a comically unexplained ambush; by the next scene, like the Bonds of old, he is recuperating by the Italian lakes, his tenderized tackle magically restored.
The problem with making Bond more real, is that everything around him then seems even more fake than usual. Craig, always a charismatic presence, often looks unsettled by that dislocation; his sex scenes are more energetic than those of his predecessors but even less convincing; he is hardly allowed any comedy. As a result, by the end of a curiously back-to-front film, when he finally gets his theme tune and introduces himself - 'Bond. James Bond' - he, like the creaky franchise itself, seems profoundly unsure whether he is coming or going."
GDO_Doc10_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,GDO,Action,Negative,James Bond Casino Royale,"So what are the commonalities between CR 2006 and CR 1967...well the comparisons are easy to see. In each there was ""no one"" playing Bond, neither one was funny and each was a meandering, spoof of a Classic iconic movie formula. The James Bond themes and prototypical characters and plot lines are so heavily ingrained in our culture that many people who have never seen a Bond film ""know"" the Bond elements. The girls, the gadgets, the fast cars, the uber-villains, the self effacing humor and none too subtle sexual (and blatantly sexist) innuendo manifest in the names of many of the female characters.
So why would someone want to ""kill the goose that laid the golden egg""?.
One can only wonder what committee was formed to create, cast, write, market and produce this generally very unsatisfying, overly complex and essentially boring storyline.
As a life long Bond fan I can easily put this movie pretty near the bottom of Bond movies that didn't work out. Not counting the disappointment from the anticipation of seeing ""how Bond became Bond"" - punctuated with the pathetic and melodramatic movie's last line, ""Bond...James Bond"" - I found myself confused by the thematic, visual and plot elements which seemed to be telling the ""Bond Story"" forward and backward at the same time. The whole notion, set up in the beginning of the film when we see Bond earning his 007 status with his 2nd kill, that this is the beginning of what we now know as the Bond legend is contradicted with all sorts of contemporary visual, metaphorical and technical elements ( a shot of the recently built Atlantis hotel in the Bahamas, the EXTENSIVE use of MODERN cell phone (which are entirely critical to the storyline), the ""wink, wink - nudge, nudge"" allusion to female sexist names - when he tells Eva Green's character ""Vesper Lynd"" that her cover name on assignment is 'Stephanie Broadchest') all add to the backdrop of the big showdown between Bond and his nemesis Le Chiffre (""The Figure"") in their ""spine tingling"" Texas hold 'em high stakes card game. Are you kidding? Bond playing Texas hold 'em poker. Until this film I never knew I could watch a game of Poker for two and a half hours - (yawn) how exciting.
Presumably, this was because of the huge appeal of this game to today's modern audience and the obvious conclusion that Bond would have preferred it to every other damn games of chance he played in ALL the other Bond films.
I'm hoping in the next one that Bond has a big adventure with Le Figure in anticipation of the big deadly lawn mowing competition...then I can watch grass grow for two hours (unless the producers decide to set another running time record).
On the positive side (yes there were positives), I was please to see the restrained and graphically creative retro-styling of the opening titles. Giving the opening a very 60's Peter Maxish (sort of) feel and loved the flashbacks in the beginning of Bond's first kill shot in somewhat grainy black and white and inter-cut with the dark, somber and foreboding lead up to his 2nd kill (which earned him his 007 status).
It was also intriguing to see a young Bond go ""off the map"" and reek havoc in a guerrilla base with some fantastic low tech chases and high wire stunts and fighting. It was a refreshing and yet perfectly logical ""opening fight/escape"" that Bond became known for. It was also great to see the female characters being more substantial and real and not simply the ""same old"" stereotypes (since his legend was far from established at this point). It also made sense that a young Bond would stumble and not necessarily be able to smoothly get around every situation. And finally, the locales and cinematography was great...not too slick and shiny and just a bit ""old school"".
""M"" / Judi Densch was, of course, fantastic as usual but were it not for her it would have seemed like: ""hey who the hell stole James Bond and replaced it with all these unknown actors"". No Moneypenny, No Q, and a Felix Leiter whose lines made him seem more like: ""if I say I work for the CIA then you need to believe me, please"" and Daniel Craig showed the acting range of a cardboard cutout, I would have been happier if they just put up a 8x10 glossy of Pierce Brosnan whenever it was time to see Craig.
In short, set your expectations low and be ready to spend a lot of time watching Poker"
RSO_Doc1_Us,Ramandeep Singh,Horror,Negative,Us,"Original Score: 2/5 Stephen A. Russell,The New Daily (Australia). They say lightning doesnt strike twice, but sometimes it does with hit movies. Ridley Scott followed up his superb The Duellists  which won best first feature at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival  with seminal sci-fi hit Alien two years later, scoring a special effects Oscar for its chest-bursting menace. Quentin Tarantino topped Reservoir Dogs with Pulp Fiction. So I was pumped for Jordan Peeles much-hyped sophomore feature Us about a family menaced by stab-happy doppelgangers, after his exhilarating, Oscar-winning debut Get Out smartly rewired the horror genre, lancing rampant racism and creeping white privilege. Sadly his flash of brilliance totally fizzles this time. A genuinely unnerving set up in a 1986 fairground totally gets the creak of terror lurking in these places, with a wide-eyed Madison Curry as a young girl attacked by her evil double after being lost in a funhouse mirror hall. Positing another clever metaphor, with Americans as their own worst enemy, Peele soon loses focus. Jumping to the present, a goofy but overlong section sets up Black Panther duo Lupita Nyongo and Winston Duke as a married couple taking a break in their wood-surrounded holiday cabin (never a good idea in horror films) with their kids, played by Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex. Taking too long to get there, Peele flubs an oddly inert home invasion when the familys maniacal scissor-wielding mirror images eventually show up. Basic jump scares abound, but theres no real terror. We do get a much more brutal attack on the neighbours, including The Handmaids Tales Elisabeth Moss, but a re-run is a re-run. The films laborious pace is further hampered by Nyongos bad reflection setting out their terms in the worst asthmatic wheezing committed to film since Tom Hardys much-memed Bane. Peele manages to bury the film in a turgid cement of tedious exposition while still leaving the basic world-building foundations decidedly wobbly. Get Out already joked about villains monologuing their dastardly plan. Pushing the same punchline here is just lazy. The patchy humour fares a bit better as the good family gets increasingly violent in their fight back, but its so on the nose it literally references Home Alone. Yeah, we got it. Pop culture call-outs galore, including an iconic line ripped from the Star Wars saga, only serve to highlight the dearth of new ideas here. With Peele borrowing liberally from better films like The Shining, it ends up feeling like a tired rehash. Speaking of which, Im not going to die and be resurrected on a hill claiming the probably unnecessary Pet Sematary reboot is a masterpiece, but it at least has more fun re-animating Stephen Kings zombie cat story with a zippier pace. Directed by Kevin Klsch and Dennis Widmyer, the movie doesnt give Jason Clarke quite enough space to really work the crazed grief of a father tortured by a devastating accident, but theres just enough here to hurt. Tinkering with the tragic 1983 novel and the 1989 movie adaptation, it delivers a couple of surprises more welcome than un-dead family members at the door. "
RSO_Doc2_Us,Ramandeep Singh,Horror,Negative,Us,"Matt Cipolla, Film Monthly, Original Score: 3/5,  June 10, 2019
Is my own doppelgnger going to kill me if I dont shower Jordan Peeles latest with praise? Am I going to rack my brain with guilt for not loving a movie Im straining to applaud? Or is something deep inside me going to make me, against my better judgment, evade the fact that Us (2019) is not a particularly good movie? It pains me to write this. The writer/director struck gold with Get Out two years ago and deservedly so, tinging each scene with social and emotional discomfort that passed for both abject horror and pitch-black comedy. It was a sterling effort that overflowed with ideas but never tried too hard and, in a choice more admirable in theory than actuality, Peele has decided not to replicate his previous success. His latest film makes it clear off the bat that this is not a satire or a bonafide social comment. Us is psychological horror in the vein of The Twilight Zone, something that Peele has aped in the past (and is even rebooting). And this works very well at first in how he, both as a writer and a director, approaches his craft with patienceno cheap scares, no silly gimmicks. With Mike Gioulakis (Under the Silver Lake) as cinematographer and a sleeker approach to both light and dark, its clear this movie is going to be something nicer to behold. But then it becomes just as clear that theres far less beneath the surface. Like when most talented filmmakers stretch themselves in too many directions, Us is full of things that just dont cohere. We start off in 1986 Santa Cruz where young Adelaide (Madison Curry) is on a birthday trip to an oceanside amusement park with her parents (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Anna Diop). It goes well enough for a while, but something takes over her. She wanders into a hall of mirrors where she sees her doppelgnger and, upon reemerging to Mom and Dad, seems to be suffering PTSD. Fast-forward to current day and Adelaide (now played by Lupita Nyongo) is headed on a vacation with her dorky husband Gabe (Winston Duke), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and son Jason (Evan Alex). The lakeside house is nice and all, but Gabe wants to take the family to the ocean. Adelaide resists but gives in for the sake of the family and that night after returning home, they spot a family in the driveway. Its all of their doppelgngersseething, primal mirror versions of themselves who only seem to act on their ids. Unlike Get Out, though, Peele keeps this central conceit pretty close to the vest for a while. Us works best when its stylish, placing its characters on a literal coast against the unknown and capturing them with a visual style that feels on the verge of wrapping around itself. Inspirations are proud but never obvious ranging from The Shining to Night of the Living Dead to more comical revisionism like Shaun of the Dead. The film is never particularly scary past the first half or so, but it has the suspense needed to be fun. And then it decides to stretch its premise into full-on comedy. This isnt inherently a bad thing, but Us plays both its psychological horror and slapstick comedy on full tilt to the point that respective sequences never mesh together. Some are admittedly funny, but Peele rarely finds the balance between this broad humor and the human core he sets up earlier. Scenes and set pieces begin to drag on for too long and, although they never become boring, they certainly wear thin, especially once you realize that theyre simple diversions from the themes Peele is trying to address. Its an almost-two-hour movie thats so frustratingly detached from itself that it falls short of coasting on its entertainment value. Peeles script reverts to hodgepodge social commentary towards the end that, although alluded to at the beginning of the film, is neglected for long enough to deflate any true sense of tension. This is especially evident through family friends Kitty and Josh (Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker), a boho-chic married couple whose own scenes never amount to anything beyond a few amusing gags.
Once Us unveils its deeper intentions, it doesnt enough prove to be that deep at all. Does it stay true to its genre-based promises? Sure, but it doesnt bend them. It pigeonholes them into a mythology too half-baked to work and the twists, while decently executed, prove to miss as often as they hit. And yet I still couldnt bring myself to entirely discredit Peeles attempts here. I just wish they added up to something. Even if Us has deeper meaningsand its clear that it does, especially given how much it telegraphs them allI wonder if Id be paying as much attention to them if Jordan Peele wasnt behind them. Us is currently available on Digital and arrives on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, DVD and On Demand on June 18, 2019 from Universal Picture Home Entertainment. Special features on the releases include scene explorations [not available on the DVD], five featurettes exploring the films themes and providing behind-the-scenes looks at the production, deleted scenes, outtakes, and an extended version of the dance sequence.

RSO_Doc3_Us,Ramandeep Singh,Horror,Negative,Us,"Jason Fraley,WTOP (Washington, D.C.), Original Score: 2.5/4. Few directorial debuts were as shattering as Jordan Peeles Oscar-winning horror flick Get Out (2017), which not only won Best Original Screenplay, but should have won Best Picture (Rewriting Oscar History). It stands as a masterpiece of cultural significance and cinematic artistry, repaying on repeat viewings with enough double meanings to fill a film theory class. Thus, we get the eager anticipation and unrealistic expectations of Us, which again boasts powerful performances of tear-stained cheeks, stunning technical prowess with symbolic imagery and sunken place social satire. This time, however, its surface-level plot piles the gory on the allegory, straining its metaphors with logical inconsistencies beneath the twists. The story opens with Young Adelaide Wilson (Madison Curry) wandering off from her parents and suffering childhood trauma at a boardwalk fun house in Santa Cruz, California. Decades later, grown-up Adelaide (Lupita Nyongo) and her husband Gabe (Winston Duke), take their kids, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), on a return trip to Santa Cruz, but their family vacation turns chaotic when dangerous doppelgngers appear in their driveway. The dual personas provide a powerful stage for Nyongo, who deserves Oscar consideration for Lead Actress six years after her Supporting Actress win for 12 Years a Slave (2013). She essentially has to play two roles: one as a traumatized middle-class mother, one as a hoarse-throated shadow figure, but both with protective maternal instincts. Youll instantly recall Daniel Kaluuyas teacup hypnosis as Nyongo keeps her eyes Peeled in bulging, teary terror.The same goes for Duke (Black Panther), who dons a Howard University sweatshirt and glasses to crack goofy dad jokes, then shifts to farsighted squints and primal moans as his shadow double. Most impressive are the child actors, as Joseph plays teenage innocence before shifting to a freaky frozen grin, and Alex playfully wears a plastic Halloween mask before shifting to his pyromaniac duplicate to wear a much creepier, canvas-style mask. Peele was inspired by the Mirror Image episode of The Twilight Zone (1960), which he is rebooting this spring. Cinephiles will also notice shades of Don Siegels Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), Michael Bays The Island (2005) and Charlie McDowells The One I Love (2014), which fittingly starred Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men) in a double role. She returns in Us with Tim Heidecker (Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!) as the wealthy parents of twins. Directing duplicates requires a carefully constructed dance of body doubles and over-the-shoulder trick shots  just ask Tatiana Maslany in BBCs Orphan Black (2013) and J.K. Simmons in Starzs Counterpart (2017). But its worth the challenge, as it provides endless possibilities for dynamic direction. In Us, Peele presents Nyongos face pressed against her reflection in the cracking glass of a coffee table, a high-angle shot of the family on the beach with long shadows stretching across the sand, and the distorted images of funhouse mirrors. The latter-most is the most disturbing in a masterful opening boardwalk sequence, where Peele blends the whistling child danger of Fritz Langs M (1931) with the beach terror of Jaws (1975), right down to Jason wearing a Jaws T-shirt (Peele reportedly asked Spielberg for permission). The fact that Young Adelaide wears a Michael Jackson Thriller T-shirt is even creepier after the King of Pops pedophilia allegations in HBOs Leaving Neverland (2019). Note the way that Peele constructs this sequence: (A) Young Adelaides face moves from light to dark (i.e. film noir), as she descends the stairs to the beach; (B) Lightning eerily flashes in the night sky in the distance; (C) An insert shot shows a candy apple abandoned in the sand as a few rain drops start to fall; (D) The rain lets loose in a downpour as Young Adelaide stands alone in the chiaroscuro-lit doorway of the fun house before plunging into a dark hellscape. The films next big set piece, the home invasion by the doppelgngers, is equally masterful, playing on the same fears of intrusion as Night of the Living Dead (1968), The Evil Dead (1981), Scream (1996), Funny Games (1997), The Others (2001), The Strangers (2008) and The Purge (2013). This is where youll clutch your date on the edge of your seat.  And then, the films tone frustratingly starts to shift, becoming less of the slow-burn suspense we got in Get Out and more of the lowest-common-denominator schlock weve seen from zombies and vampires of monster movies past. Act 2 still offers moments of bloody delight and inspired choices, particularly a bubbly soundtrack that runs counterpoint to the grisly action, like Kubricks use of Singin in the Rain in A Clockwork Orange (1971). Here, its the Beach Boys Good Vibrations, which cuts to a hilarious Alexa joke that we refuse to spoil.  Not only does the tone shift, the rules of magic slowly start to unravel with plot holes and logical inconsistencies that undermine the otherwise brilliant twists of Act 3. For instance, why do some dopplegangers move in unison with the humans (i.e. the son), while others are able to move freely? By the end, their exact origins remain sketchy even after the ultimate reveal. The entire construct feels half-baked and not fully formed. By the time we reach the White Swan vs. Black Swan ballerina showdown a la Black Swan (2010), we wish that Peele would have given the script another rewrite or two to flesh out the story logic. While Get Out sent us out of the theater in awe, many viewers will leave Us scratching their heads in confusion. Dont worry, there are still plenty of Peeles symbolic visual staples: reproductive rabbits, untethering scissors, the speedboat name Craw Daddy, toy ambulances and the numbers 11:11, including the time on digital clocks, an 11-11 baseball score and the mystery Bible verse Jeremiah 11:11: Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them. This doom exists from the opening image of a TV set (i.e. Poltergeist) showing a 1986 Hands Across America commercial, which comes full circle in the closing image as a subversive analogy for President Donald Trumps border wall. When the shadow family is asked their identity, they simply respond, We are Americans. Thus, the title Us should be read as U.S. This larger social commentary is timely, exposing the class divides of two parallel worlds, one of privilege, one of plight, unfolding in simultaneous realities. And yet, like Darren Aronofskys mother! (2017), the underlying metaphors never fully gel with the surface-level A-story plot, which is what Get Out did so well, marrying the surface ride with the hidden symbolic layers. Us is more of a straight slasher genre piece, for better or worse, but its no sophomore slump because it proves Peeles vocabulary of consistent auteur trademarks. If we watched it before Get Out, the result might have impressed us as a lowbrow horror/comedy by one half of Key & Peele. But now that were watching it after the elevated experience of Get Out, theres a slight air of disappointment selfishly crying out, Another masterpiece please!. Alas, you cant hit a home run every time. Us is still very much worth a watch  a genius firing on most cylinders is a better use of your time than lesser filmmakers at their best. Just expect a suspenseful, nightmarish, even puzzling ride with more questions than answers. I have a hunch audience scores are going to be more mixed than the critical raves thus far. What we have here is M. Night Shyamalan after his Sixth Sense breakthrough akin to Get Out. Plenty of juicy twists await, but can anything ever match it? Either way, its exciting to have a new auteur in the horror genre where we cant wait to see what he does next."

Writer-director Jordan Peeles 2017 Get Out was a brash and intriguing debut, a picture that wrestled with the notion of whether or not America can ever be a post-racial society: Vital and spooky, it refused to hand over easy answers. With the ambitious home-invasion horror chiller Us, Peele goes even deeper into the conflicted territory of class and race and privilege; he also ponders the traits that make us most human. But this time, hes got so many ideas he can barely corral them, let alone connect them. He overthinks himself into a corner, and were stuck there with him. Lupita Nyongo stars as Adelaide, who has overcome a traumatic childhood experience and now has a family of her own, including husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two kids: graceful, well-adjusted Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and the slightly more awkward Jason (Evan Alex), who wears a wolfman mask pushed up on his head as a kind of security blanket. We meet the comfortably middle-class Wilson family as theyre heading off on vacation to Santa Cruz, the site of Adelaides childhood ordeal. On their first night away, they look out and see a family of four, mute and stony echoes of themselves, standing in the driveway. From there, Peele unspools a story of shadow people, long forced to live underground but now streaming to the Earths surface to claim, violently, what they feel is rightfully theirs. The effectiveness of Us may depend on how little you know about it going in, so the spoiler-averse may wish to stop reading here. But its impossible to address any of the movies larger ideas without giving away key plot points: Before long, that shadow family has infiltrated the house, and now that we can get a good look, we see that each of them is a not-quite-right replica of a Wilson, dressed in a red jumpsuit and wielding a pair of menacing-looking shears. At one point a terrified Adelaide asks the other mother, a twin of herself but with vacant, crazy eyes and a demented smile, What are you people? We are Americans, the lookalike responds, in a whispery growl. Thats a bright, neon-lit Authors Message if ever there was one, though the idea of using a group of sunlight-deprived semi-zombies as a metaphorical element in a parable about class complacency isnt necessarily a bad one. Are you and your family doing great? Do you live in a nice place, drive an expensive car, and have plenty of food for everyone to eat? Be grateful for it. But be aware that there are others who, through no fault of their own, dont live at the same comfort levelor are, in fact, barely surviving. (The Wilsons also have close friends, Josh and Kitty, played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss, who have more money and nicer stuff than they do, a source of irritation for Gabe in particular, and another of the movies threads about class consciousness in America.) But Peele doesnt always lay out his ideas clearly. Us isnt always fun to watch; there are stretches where its plodding and dour. Hes overly fond of heavy-duty references, including Biblical ones: A creepy dude holds a sign that reads Jeremiah 11:11. (If you dont know it outright, its the one that goes, Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.) The mood of Us is sometimes chilling, but even then, youre not always sure what, exactly, is chilling you. Maybe its just the feeling of being trapped in an over-air-conditioned lecture hall, because theres a strain of preachiness running through the whole thing. One thing thats unquestionable: Peele is a dazzling visual stylist. (Peeles cinematographer is Mike Gioulakis, who also shot David Robert Mitchells It Follows, as well as M. Night Shyamalans Split and Glass.) The movies opening, which details young Adelaides nightmareit takes place in a ghoulish hall of mirrors on the Santa Cruz boardwalkis a mini-horror masterpiece by itself, an evocation of the outright weirdness of childhood rather than its wonder: As the girl wanders away from her parents, in an almost trancelike state, she clutches a candied apple so shiny its like blood-red crystal balland puts us in a trance, too. Yet the rest of Us is laden with metaphors, and they pile up so quickly that not even Peele can keep up with them. The movie repeatedly references Hands Across America, a 1986 benefit event in which some 6.5 million people joined hands along a route mapped out across the contiguous United States. (Many participants had donated $10 to reserve a space in the chain; the money was donated to local charities dedicated to fighting hunger and ending poverty.) In Us, the shadow people form a similar chain. But its hard to know what Peele is trying to say with that image. Are the semi-zombies of Us just less fortunate versions of us? Are they actually us and we dont know it? Is their clumsy anger somehow superior to thought and reason? After all, it has unified them, while we aboveground humans are more divided than ever. How, in the end, are we supposed to feel about these shadow people, for so long deprived of basic human rightsincluding daylightthat they have become murderous clones? Sometimes great movies are ambiguous, but ambiguity resulting from unclear thinking makes nothing great. Its one thing for a movie to humble you by leaving you unsure about yourself and your place in the world; its another for it to leave you wondering what, exactly, a filmmaker is trying to use his formidable verbal and visual vocabulary to say.

RSO_Doc5_Us,Ramandeep Singh,Horror,Negative,Us,".   The title of Toni Morrisons new essay collection, The Source of Self-Regard, indicates what should be the point of the horror-comedy Us, if Us had a point. Morrison figures out the roots of identity, personal awareness, and artistic ambition. Through 43 compositions mostly about race, reprinted without original dates and bound in a subtly defiant pink jacket, the Nobel prize winner reintroduces herself to the woke generation. Morrisons examples of belles lettres contradict Jordan Peeles low-brow Hollywood-backed hucksterism, yet she addresses the generation that Hollywood has learned to control, especially in this moment, when inclusion and diversity are little more than marketing strategies. How better to sell Black Lives Matter tickets than by calling a movie Us? The actors who portray the besieged black family in Us were obviously cast for their dark skin tone. Writer-director Peele apparently likes the political horror-comedy frisson of colorism, using Lupita Nyongo (Patsey in 12 Years a Slave) and Winston Duke (MBaku in Black Panther) the same way he cast Daniel Kaluuya in Get Out  as ultra-blacks. This nontraditional Hollywood casting is more than counterintuitive; its a specious form of authenticity. Peele emphasizes racial difference  taunting it  but without Morrisons in-depth exploration. During 1970s blaxploitation, filmmakers exploited black beauty by eroticizing dark-skin actresses such as Brenda Sykes, Gloria Hendry, Judy Pace, Mae Mercer; and photographer-turned-director Gordon Parks cast former model Richard Roundtree as ebony-hard detective Shaft. It might seem impolite to bring all this up, but its important to grasp actor-comedian Peeles temerity, which has been taken seriously since his 2017 hit Get Out won acclaim for treating race as a visual joke. Peele exploits race without owning up to the manipulation. Showcasing his actors surface physiognomy is part of an insidious ploy, often used by race-hustling politicians, that Peele himself probably doesnt completely understand. Inadvertently, his movies follow the lineage of black movie caricatures without improving them: Coal-black Nyongo and Duke are PC exaggerations of the black American phenotype. When they get bug-eyed, just as 193040s comic actors Willie Best and Mantan Moreland did, Peeles audience is signaled to not only laugh but be frightened. Fear is Peeles idea of cultural progress. Us pretends to critique black social progress via horror-comedy shtick. Nyongo and Duke play bourgeois couple Adelaide and Gabe Wilson  artistic, proper-speaking, and unappealing yuppies (buppies) who, along with their TV-commercial-styled children Zora and Jason, vacation at a fashionable beach town. The exclusivity of the Wilsons upscale retreat is violated by crazed mutants  freak-show doppelgngers who attack the family, seeking revenge for reasons unspecified beyond haves-vs.-have-nots. (Peeles contrived explanation is ludicrous.) The Wilson familys travail indicates race guilt (not the all-American dystopia of Brian Taylors horror-comedy Mom and Dad). Yet there isnt a single moment of empathy between the characters  only hysteria as the Wilsons attempt to survive with their privilege intact. Peele depicts this struggle superficially and incoherently, as he did in Get Out. He knows that race makes peoples heads spin. Add bludgeoning musical effects, an illogical, subTwilight Zone premise, plus bloodshed, and critics will genuflect, taking Peeles manipulation to be sociologically profound. But thrill-ride gimmicks that distract from the concepts incoherence expose Peeles essential non-seriousness. His beach scene incompetently mimics Jaws, and his pop-music references are dubious: The Beach Boys Good Vibrations is used during ironic Tarantino mayhem, and Peele proves his cultural ignorance when he misses the chance to underscore a call for the police with Roxanne, the song by British rock band The Police that Eddie Murphy wailed and subverted in 48 Hrs. Instead, Peele blares N.W.A.s F*** tha Police. Yawn. This films doppelgngers  inarticulate, dressed like convicts, and carrying gold shears  claim that they are tethered to the Wilsons. Were Americans! they announce, then inflict imprisonment (beatings and handcuffs) like specters from Ava DuVernays prison-industrial-complex fetish. In pale imitation of the classic horror-film concept of the return of the repressed, a neighboring white family (headed by PC standard-bearer Elisabeth Moss) is also beset by replicant ghouls. Peele attempts to revive the discredited post-racial notion from 2008. But political reality outstrips his comedy routine. Us runs up against the American Descendants of Slavery (ADOS) movement, which isnt founded on fright-movie terms but insists on confronting the horrific past without make-believe. Black social fears are not alleviated through the teasing and mockery seen in Us; only clueless viewers would think so, and they turn out to be the audience most susceptible to Peeles race-based conceits. Critics have praised Us as a satire on class envy, especially black upward mobility, yet Candace Owens lays waste to Peeles post-racial folly with her suggestion that the recent bureaucratic exoneration of Jussie Smollett destroyed the myth of white privilege. The Wilsons may be dark-skinned, but theyre the whitest-acting movie characters ever seen on screen. The class charade substitutes for Peeles inability to grasp the lingering effects of slavery or see through the phoniness of Peeles race-baiting. His notion of being tethered to mutants suckers white liberals just as the sunken place notion suckered disconcerted blacks struggling with their own unarticulated miseries. Theyre being preached at by a bad comic who specializes in ridiculing black pathology. Interpreting Peeles silliness  early nods to The Man with Two Brains, C.H.U.D., and The Goonies  doesnt go beyond his trivializing black American deprivation into junk-movie entertainment. And no intelligent moviegoer should be impressed by his tonier affectations, which are mere sketch comedy. He starts Us with a prologue of preteen Adelaide wearing a Michael Jackson Thriller T-shirt, wandering off from her parents at a carnival in 1986. She winds up in a Find Yourself haunted-house attraction where she sees her likeness in a mirror  its the back of a little black girls head, evoking Ren Magrittes 1937 painting Not to Be Reproduced. Given the political funhouse that the United States has become since 2008, Peeles obsidian mirror goes no deeper than a carnival hoax. Its the same game as Viola Davis and Cynthia Erivo staring face to face like Ibo vs. Dahomey statues in Steve McQueens Widows  a middlebrow art affectation such as the 1980s black gallery exhibitions Toni Morrison critiques in her essay Harlem on My Mind: Contesting Memory  Meditation on Museums, Culture, and Integration. The woke generation that Morrison pursues is not more literate than their ancestors who read Morrisons Beloved. (Some of them even appreciated Jonathan Demmes bold film adaptation, which others scoffed at as a black version of The Exorcist.) But gullible responses to Get Out and Us show that woke viewers outsmart themselves and are cinema illiterate, and Hollywood knows a surefire way to trick-or-treat them: Under the horror-movie rubric, the woke generation will fall for anything. From here on, I will no longer refer to Jordan Peele as a race hustler. Us proves he is something simpler: a charlatan."
RSO_Doc6_Us,Ramandeep Singh,Horror,Positive,Us,"Brian Eggert, Deep Focus Review, Original Score: 3/4. In the first season of the original run of The Twilight Zone, theres an episode that aired in 1960 called Mirror Image in which Vera Miles plays Millicent Barnes, a woman waiting for a bus. Not given to even the most temporal flights of fantasy, Millicent soon becomes afraid that a doppelgnger is stalking her. Justified paranoia sets in as, sure enough, her double from a parallel dimension has come to replace her. Rod Serlings metaphysical tale was a source of inspiration for writer-director Jordan Peele, whose second film Us explores this concept in a feature-length horror story. And no wonder, since Peele will executive produce and host a new iteration of The Twilight Zone to debut on the streaming platform CBS All Access later in 2019. Peeles second film runs more than 90 minutes longer than Mirror Image, and although he doesnt explore the origins or explanations of why doppelgngers attack in any Profoundly satisfying way, he nonetheless delivers a tense experience with several wonderfully crafted sequences of terror. Peeles follow-up to his Oscar-winning breakthrough Get Out (2017) was bound to incite enthusiasm, and perhaps even unreasonable expectations. After transitioning out of sketch comedy, Peele made one of the most impressive debuts ever put to filma thriller that demonstrated he was both a studied filmmaker and perceptive social commentator, with a story that exposed how entrenched racism can emerge in the most unassuming of places. Us doesnt have the same clarity of purpose, but Peele ratchets-up the shocks and suspense with the confidence of a more experienced director. As suggested by his ode to Mirror Image, hes exploring referential territory here, and Us touches on slashers and the home invasion subgenre in exciting ways. Similar to his approach in Get Out, Peele cannot help but inject humor into the proceedings. And while the film should not be called a horror-comedy, it boasts some hilarious moments peppered into moments of grueling horror.  Us opens with an ominous warning that thousands of miles of tunnels exist beneath the United States, and their function ranges from abandoned subway tunnels to forgotten spaces, all beneath our feet. Then the film transitions to 1986 on the boardwalk of Santa Cruz, where a little girl named Adelaide (Madison Curry) finds herself drawn away from her parents and into a carnival attraction called Shamans Vision Quest. Inside a hall of mirrors, she sees countless versions of herself in reflection, until one of those reflections comes to life. Its an incident that leads to post-traumatic stress disorder for the young Adelaide, who, as a present-day adult (played by the great Lupita Nyongo), still harbors anxiety about that beachside incident. When Adelaide and her family, including husband Gabe (Winston Duke), teen daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and young son Jason (Evan Alex), visit their vacation house near that area, she begins to notice a series of double-related coincidences that, given her childhood trauma, equate to doom.
How right she is. That night, her family is visited by four doppelgngers who refer to themselves as the Tethered, and theres one for each family member. Each double is dressed in a MAGA-red jumpsuit, wears a single brown-leather driving glove, and carries a golden pair of scissors. What are you? Gabe asks them. The double of Adelaide, who talks with a raspy voice as though its the first time shes ever spoken aloud, replies, Were Americans. Peele turns Us into an allegory whose purpose is already being debated among critics and viewers. But rather than a straightforward commentary, he delivers a cinematic Rorschach test that allows the viewer to choose their own psychological interpretation of what aspect of Americans the Tethered represent. Some have suggested the film is about the way the United States attempts to bury its past crimes against African Americans or Native American tribes. Others claim the Tethered are not a specific historical reference but a call for Americans to pause in self-reflection and look at what weve become. Or maybe these alter-egos reflect the polarization of Americans in the present culture war, with the Tethered representing the silent majority who seem driven by a hatred of everyone else. With allusions to secret government projects involving control, Us lets your inner conspiracy theorist out to play.
Whatever the Tethered represent, its apparent that Us is more successful as a relentless tale of survival than a readable commentary. Unfortunately, the films openness to interpretation also bleeds into a crucial moment of plot exposition. Without going into detail, theres a scene in which a character explains whats going on and why, and the clarification doesnt make much sense, leaving a few distracting plot holes that threaten to derail the films otherwise flawless momentum. The viewer is left asking questions: How did the Tethered become so organized? Who is feeding the bunnies (there are a lot of bunnies here)? Who supplied the red jumpsuits? If the scissors are symbolic of the Tethered cutting free from their counterparts, then why a single driving glove? Who made the underground tunnels and why? Once the viewer starts looking for satisfying answers to these questions, it becomes too easy to get caught up in the fact that Peele hasnt provided them. Although, he leaves plenty of clues for the viewer along the way. What works best about the film is everything leading up to this underwhelming denouement. Long before we have an inkling about why the events are happening, Us involves Adelaide and her family running and fighting for their lives against the Tethered, and cinematographer Mike Gioulakis captures the action in clear, cohesive bursts of jolting violence. These sequences feature breathless cat-and-mouse chases and shocking deaths, and a particularly good use of the supporting roles by Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker as family friends. Their screeching, spider-walking doppelgngers carry eerie smiles and seem determined to unite in a statement recalling Hands Across America, the activist event of the 1980s that found 6.5 million people linked in a human chain from coast to coast. Peele also sets gruesome scenes to the diegetic presence of The Beach Boys Good Vibrations and another to N.W.A.s Fuck Tha Police, alternating the tone between horrifying and funny. Michael Abels score also switches between grandiose choral chants and an unnerving nod to Lunizs I Got 5 On It, another song with a significant place on the soundtrack. Watching Us, its almost too easy to overlook that Peeles cast has delivered dual performances; each is distinct enough that, from the moment the doubles appear onscreen, the physical presence and facial expressions of each signal an entirely different characterNyongo, Duke, and Moss above all. Thats part of what makes viewing the film such an immersive experience, despite the unclear statement and plot holes. Peele has committed most of his films runtime to an unyielding, scary premise that proves the filmmaker has his audience wrapped around his little finger. But whereas Get Out engaged both the intellect and our primal needs as moviegoers, Us strikes our most visceral responses before petering out toward the end. Still, Peele maintains such a high degree of interest and horror that its impossible not to feel the experience demands appreciation for what it achieves, but also further self-exploration about what it means.

RSO_Doc7_Us,Ramandeep Singh,Horror,Positive,Us,"David Gonzalez Reel Talk Inc. Original Score: 4/4. In 2017, Jordan Peele entered the spotlight as one of Hollywoods great new directors with the release of Get Out, a film that used horror as a backdrop to refract race relations in todays America. Smart modern usage of the genre that catapulted the director to an Academy Award win for Best Original Screenplay. While Get Out is out to send a powerful message, the films finale fails to stick its landing in categorizing it as one of the greats of the 2010s. This opinion stems from the films final 20 minutes.  While the first 80 minutes focus on race relations and strays away from a conventional horror film, its climax turns into a clich including an uneven turn where brain surgery is the source of the events that have taken place throughout the narrative. Two years later, Jordan Peele has returned with his sophomore outing, Us, a thought-provoking excursion that is nothing short of a colossal cinematic achievement. Peeles new film is both darker and more ambitious, and broader in its themes and immediately enters the category of a modern day masterpiece. What makes Us so unique is it can bypass the concept of genre and make the audience sit, think, and create a mindset and opinion about what the theme of this film is. Similarly to classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (a sci-fi film), The Godfather Parts 1 and 2 (a crime drama), Us falls under the horror genre but its so much more than that. Like the previously mentioned classics, the film creates conversations and debate among moviegoers as to what Peele is trying to tell us. On the surface, the film is positioned as a home-invasion style horror film. Add in Peeles creative mind and Us rises above its horror genre definition. The films real purpose is to look at the big picture of cultural consciousness and the cultural unconscious. The moral compass that lies in all of us that is quick to create an opinion of someone without knowing all the facts. Us is the self-examination of a human being.  Along with Peeles direction, Winston Duke, Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Evan Alex should be commended for their duel performances. Duke continues to show why he is on the rise as one of Hollywoods consistent actors. From Black Panther to Us, Duke shows no signs of being typecast and will not shy away from accepting new roles which will add to the depth of his repertoire. While Joseph and Alex can differentiate, both parts played in a way where compassion can still be had for both roles each of these child actors took in the film. Did I miss someone? Oh yes, then theres Lupita Nyongos take as Adelaide/Red. A year ago, cinephiles were craving for an Academy Award nomination for the brutally raw performance by Toni Collette in Hereditary. While the nomination failed to come to fruition, there is a sense that Lupita is on her way to break the horror genre Oscar nomination curse as her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece. Nyongos performance propels the story forward. She extracts and displays emotion from both of her characters with an incredible amount of depth and range. A performance that will make you question whether two people are playing these characters and realizing that she is phenomenal in showcasing their duality. Lupita should not only be considered a shoo-in for a nomination come awards season but it would not shock me if she becomes a two-time Oscar winner. Michael Abels score aids the film by adding all the necessary tension and anxiety for the audience to experience even going as far as become a central character in the movie. The use of I Got 5 on It is something I never knew I wanted until I got it. Abels use of the track near the films finale is a genius move and something you need to see onscreen for yourself. As a fan of 90s hip-hop, I certainly will never look at this track the same again. The best way for me to compare this brilliant film is by looking at a modern day musical genius, Kendrick Lamar. When he released his first album, good kid, m.A.A.d city, Lamar provided listeners with an in-depth, in your face look at life in Compton. With his sophomore outing, To Pimp A Butterfly, Lamar chose to take a different route and release a more thought invoking album that created a buzz around Lamars change in direction. A few years have passed, and To Pimp A Butterfly is now viewed as a classic. Just like that, Us has confirmed that Peele has become a tour de force as a director in Hollywood. His fearlessness in filmmaking has become abundantly clear and hes willing to take the necessary narrative risks in his writing and direction similarly to Alfred Hitchcock. Hes slowly but surely earning his spot to be one of Hollywoods great directors.

RSO_Doc8_Us,Ramandeep Singh,Horror,Positive,Us,"Nicols Delgadillo, Discussing Film, Original Score: 4 / 5. If, for whatever reason, you were still having doubts that Jordan Peele, half the mind behind Key and Peele, which filled the void left from Chappelles Show, and the entire mind behind 2017s monster hit Get Out, as well as the upcoming Twilight Zone reboot, consider them extinguished with the release of Us. Peele has solidified himself as one of the most important and pensive artists of the current generation and beyond, and hes firing on all cylinders with his sophomore film. The themes and ideas put forth are grander and more all-encompassing than Get Out  this winds up being both good and bad, but the sheer ambition and genius behind it all continues to be mightily impressive. In 1986, a young girl named Adelaide (Madison Curry) is on vacation at the Santa Cruz boardwalk with her parents. Adelaide wanders off while the adults are distracted, as children are prone to do, and winds up exploring a house of mirrors on the beach. What she encounters in there is enough to scar her for life, so much to the point that shes unable to speak for a considerable amount of time afterwards. Jump to the present day, and a fully grown Adelaide (Lupita Nyongo) is returning to Santa Cruz and facing her fears, along with her husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), and their two children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). What starts off as a fun and refreshing vacation immediately turns into a violent and terrifying nightmare. Four strangers, clad in matching red jumpsuits and each wielding large scissors, show up at the familys summer home, and they have a thirst for blood. The scariest part? They look exactly like them. Peele is paying homage to the classic horror flicks of the 80s here, and he proudly scatters references and stages scenes inspired by them throughout his film. A young Adelaide wanders the dark beach in an oversized Michael Jacksons Thriller tee, Jason rocks a Jaws shirt for most of the movie, and a news report echoes the feelings of Night of the Living Dead. Theres no shortage of scares to experience in Us, the most notable being the home invasion sequence thats dominated most of the marketing. The use of darkness, tight spaces, and angles drive home the fact that the Wilsons are trapped and the walls are both literally and figuratively closing in. Us is far more creepy and unsettling than Get Out was, due in large part to phenomenal performances from the cast pulling double duty, and the violence is on par with the best slasher films. Nyongo dominates the screen as both Adelaide and her sinister counterpart, playing each role so drastically differently and relying not solely on a change of voice but a change of physicality, that youd swear they were inhabited by different actors. Adelaide is a former ballerina, and thus moves with speed, grace, and lightness, but her shadow moves in very staticky and jerky movements, more like a machine or a puppet than a normal human being. The doppelgangers, who call themselves The Tethered, are a bold statement in concept alone. Literally living underground, their lives are filled with nothing but pain and misery while their other halves get to enjoy the sunlight and all the glorious things the world has to offer.  Its here that Peele unleashes his true ideas with Us  its a funhouse mirror reflection back at the audience, at all of us, that forces us to look at the cost of our lives and the way we live them. Its no accident that the Wilsons are shown to be an upper class family (not filthy rich but certainly not struggling, they have a summer house for gods sake), with a dynamic that mimics the standard American image: The no-nonsense mother, the goofy father, the standoffish daughter, and the troublemaker son. We often forget, or rather, continuously choose to ignore, the price of that kind of lifestyle. How many people around the world suffer not just while we flourish, but suffer in order for us to flourish? The Tethered are the ultimate symbol for the forgotten people that excessive living steps on and abuses in order to maintain itself  theyre a stinging and uncomfortable look at the lives we destroy and put out of our minds so that we can enjoy that summer home, that new car, that iPhone, those new clothes. And of course they look like us, not just to remind us that these are people and not monsters, but to show that the true horror, the true murderers, the true enemies, are us. Its a brilliant metaphor, and Peele mostly succeeds at the numerous themes and concepts he stuffs into the nearly two hour film. But they are numerous, and as the film goes on it can begin to feel a bit overly ambitious, and the lack of focus and precision bleeds through, especially when you compare it to the very streamlined Get Out. Theres so much to unpack with Us that it feels impossible to wrap your mind around all that it has to offer with just one watch. Similar to his first film, Peele practically demands multiple viewings, and its certain to spawn even more videos and essays breaking it all down and explaining the various references, Easter eggs, and themes. The movie feels like it couldve benefited from either being split into two parts or finding a single idea to focus a bit more on instead of throwing all of them together at once. Still, Us is a hell of a ride thats bursting with Peeles now signature style and humor. The final confrontation is one of my favorite movie moments of the year, and its ending lands on a truly unsettling gut punch. Dont sleep on this one."
RSO_Doc9_Us,Ramandeep Singh,Horror,Positive,Us," Rick Marshall, Digital Trends. Jordan Peeles 2017 thriller Get Out turned one half of sketch comedy duo Key & Peele into one of Hollywoods hottest filmmakers, earning the first-time director an Academy Award and prompting the inevitable question of how anyone could follow up on a success on that level. So its with no small amount of anticipation  and high expectations  that Peeles latest film, simply titled Us, arrives in theaters. Although it doesnt pack the psychological punch that Get Out did, Us confirms that Peeles phenomenally successful debut was no fluke  and that the praise hes been given is indeed well deserved. Written, produced, and directed by Peele, Us follows a family whose beach vacation is interrupted one night by a vicious group of home invaders. The terror of the encounter is amplified by the discovery that the assailants are twisted versions of each member of the family  and theyre forced to fend off their murderous counterparts if they have any hope of surviving the night. Get Out initially showed Peeles talent at not only casting the right actors, but drawing performances out of them that are full of surprises. His skill at assembling and utilizing a talented cast shines again in Us, which reunites Black Panther actors Lupita Nyongo and Winston Duke as Adelaide and Gabe Wilson, a married couple on vacation with their son Jason and daughter Zora, played by Evan Alex and Shahadi Wright Joseph, respectively. All four of the primary cast members bring an impressive level of depth to characters that could have easily slipped into typically forgettable victim roles, pausing when they should be running, or screaming when they should be hiding. Theyre a smart bunch, even when they make head-shakingly bad decisions that put them in peril, and their chemistry as a family unit goes a long way toward creating an emotional investment in their fates. Portraying both the victim and the villain in a story is a tall order for any actor, but the cast of Us makes it look effortless. The performances of the four leads as the Winston family members are impressive on their own, but Us reaches even higher by having the four actors also play their psychopathic duplicates.  Portraying both the victim and the villain in a story is a tall order for any actor, but the cast of Us makes it look effortless, adding depth to both roles where appropriate and selling the audience on both the terrorized familys strength of will and their mirror images remorseless, unpredictable deadly intent. Nyongo in particular is fascinating to watch, and she goes above and beyond simple good and evil representation by giving each character their own, unique way of walking, talking, and carrying themselves. The extra effort that Nyongo and her castmates put into their two-part performances pays off with some genuinely disturbing juxtapositions of the characters and their twins, who are eerily similar on the surface despite being completely different in every other way.  Not everything about Us is a paired set, though  particularly when it comes to the films similarities (or lack thereof) with Get Out. Although Us confirms that Peeles knack for horror wasnt a one-trick act, those expecting a film that mines the same fright material as Get Out wont find much in common with that film. Where Get Out relied heavily on psychological terrors and a creeping sense of dread in a relatively bloodless  right up until its third act, at least  mind-bending scary story, Us is a more straightforward horror film. The eerie mystery of the doppelgangers existence is secondary to the blunt terror of their home invasion and pursuit of the Wilson family, and theres little question about exactly what kind of film Us really is. To Peeles credit as a writer, he does an admirable job of streamlining the narrative to move past the storys big questions in relatively quick, semi-satisfying ways, but his focus on making the film a more straightforward experience than Get Out could still leave some audiences wanting more answers when it comes to the more complicated plot points he introduces. Us is a slasher movie first and foremost, after all, even if it does have some narrative (and socially relevant) layers to unpack for audiences interested in going down that road. Its not likely to receive the level of critical acclaim as its predecessor, but Us still manages to carve out an impressive niche for itself in the horror genre. Subversive, scary, and fantastically well acted, Us is the sort of film that can be enjoyed on one level as an entertaining, satisfying slasher film, while also offering something for audiences who want more than just a family being terrorized by a group of psychotic killers. What it occasionally lacks in satisfying answers, it more than makes up for in ambition and cinematic execution, thanks to the films talented cast and filmmaker. Us probably wont bring Peele another Academy Award, but if the films intent is to be the sort of movie that sticks with you long after the credits roll, and that fuels a nightmare or two, its already a winner."
RSO_Doc10_Us,Ramandeep Singh,Horror,Positive,Us,"Michael J. Casey, Original Score: 3.5/5  The story of Us begins in 1986, on the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, with a young girl, Adelaide Wilson (Madison Curry), and her two parents. Dads a little drunk, but he does manage to win her a Thriller t-shirt and buy her a candy apple. Moms a little frustrated; this is probably not the first time hes staggered around in public with herky-jerky foolishness. And, like most children, Adelaide silently watches. She doesnt know what they are fighting about, but she knows theyre fighting. Shes seen it before, and like any child bored with their parents, wanders off. First to the beach, then to Merlins Hall of Mirrors, where an arrow pointing to the entrance promises she will find herself. And she does: first in reflection, then in reality. Jump to the present and Adelaide (Lupita Nyongo) is now grown with children of her own: Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). Along with her husband, Gabe (Winston Duke)one of the doofiest fathers in recent memorythey are headed to their vacation home on the Monterey Bay, a bit too close to Santa Cruz than Adelaide might like. The memory of that one erie night still haunts her. But as is common, she is told everything is fine; dont worry about it. Then, one night, a family of four appears in Adelaides driveway: a beefy father, a slight mother, a teenage daughter, and a skinny boy. They are wearing red jumpsuits, sandals, tan-colored driving gloves on their right hand, and carry large, sinister-looking pairs of scissors. This second family forces their way inside, corner Adelaide and her brood in the living room where just a little bit of light takes the story into a very dark place: The family in the red jumpsuits looks remarkably, unmistakably, uncannily likeTheyre us, Jason says. Indeed they are. But something is off. The father moves with a lumbering zombie-like quality, groaning and croaking more than talking. The son, his face hidden behind an S&M mask, crawls on all fours like a spider. The sister moves with silent, robotic qualities, and the mother speaks as if a lifetime of language catches in her throat. She tells a tale, a horrific tale of subterranean existence and righteous uprising. The Wilsons are not the only family with red-suited doppelgangersthe title Us carries a double meaningbut they are the only family we see that has some success fighting back. The violence here is slowmaybe too slowand favors blunt instruments over gunplay. As the fight between the Wilsons and the alternate-Wilsons drags on, the Wilsons become injured. They hobble and staggering around, screaming and grunting with primal ferocity, their white and gray clothes drenched in crimson blood until neither the Plain nor the Star-Bellied Sneetches knew whether this one was that one, or that one was this one, or which one was what one, or what one was who. Coincidentally, Dr. Seuss The Sneetches also took place on a beach. There are a lot of coincidences in Us, coincidences writer, producer, director Jordan Peele piles on like Haruki Murakami shifting into neutral. Theres a point in Us where if you squint just the right way, it starts to make sense. But then Peele dives deeper, complicating the story, explaining the mystery, and confounding the logic. Theres even a last-second twist that might undermine everything that came before. Us might have been better if the third act was tighter, the reveal less in-depth, and the allegory less obvious. But then it wouldnt be Us. Theres a messiness here, a beautiful anamorphic widescreen messiness that Peele seems to relish. Look closely during the opening shot of a TV playing a Hands Across America spot. The VHS tapes stacked against the cathode ray box include The Right Stuff and the cult horror film C.H.U.D. Us exists between the two."
SSM_Doc1_BabyDriver,SSM,Action,Positive,Baby Driver,"Through the smash-bang symphony Baby Driver, Edgar Wright, the beloved genre king behind Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, brings passion to pulp. Baby Driver is nearly two hours of joy, spontaneity, creativity and gripping gravity, all packaged in a Rube Goldberg machine, where every finger tap, blinking light, music note, street sign and engine rev is timed to the moment. Wrights attempt at the car chase movie certainly crosses off all of the boxes associated with effective engine entertainment. The hero is cool and confident, theres a girl at his side, the bad guys are slack-jawed and mean, the action is fast, the music is loud, the road gets narrower with every turn. But, where Wrights movie steers away from the pack is through the characters. We all know Wrights penchant for rat-a-tat dialogue and smash-cut storytelling. But here he shows off one of his rarest traits developing rich characters out of established stereotypes and turning them to iron when the tension heats up. Youre as thrilled as you are stomach-lumped by the outcome. You deeply care. Our hero, Baby (a splendid, assured Ansel Elgort), is cool. He wears a cool jacket, walks in a cool way, dances in the getaway car during the car robbery, rocks shades inside (and probably at night, knowing the type). Hes somewhere between Ryan Goslings characters in La La Land and Drive. James Deans grandkid. Harrison Fords nephew. The cool loner. But hes also winged. Hes got a nasty case of tinnitus that leads him to consistently pump music into his ears in order to block out the ringing. Wright makes his Baby  a reluctant getaway driver for a dangerous mobster named Doc (Kevin Spacey, noted scenery chewer)  very slick, but very vulnerable. He cares for his adopted father, an elderly deaf man, and is constantly reminded of the tragic car accident that killed his mother and left him with, as Doc says, a hum in his drum. Again, look at these characters. Baby already feels iconic the way Elgort carries himself, the glances in the car, the complex personality. Wright frames him with just the right amount of sure-handed style and careful innocence. Hes a good kid in a bad spot, and all involved give Baby something special. Docs crew members could have been shallow sycophants in other hands, but Wright fleshes them out. Wright gives all these characters humanizing scenes, lending them weight and making them more dangerous. Just like with his characters, every scene, every movement, every line of dialogue has some sort of purpose and power. Its all for a reason, which makes the film startlingly confident in itself and its quality. Wright must know hes got a heck of a movie on his hands here  the rip-roaring soundtrack is in lockstep with every scene. The songs quickly become the films backbone. Everything here astounds  the car chases ripple with bravado, the dialogue scenes cut deep, the action is masterfully cut, shot and performed, the relationship between Baby and Deborah aches with love and longing. Every actor is on the top of their game here, likely under the coaching of a true auteur. Its so methodically brilliant. So many adjectives, but all fit like a driving glove. This is one of those movies you throw big, glowing words at, hoping people get the message and buy a ticket. Masterpiece is a big word. Instant classic is a bold claim. But here, theyre in order. Edgar Wright has crafted a true masterpiece, an instant classic that will be enjoyed for years to come"
SSM_Doc2_BabyDriver,SSM,Action,Positive,Baby Driver,"Baby Driver tells the story of Baby (Ansel Elgort), a getaway driver who lives in his own world, one that has a constant soundtrack. Baby meets a girl, Debora (Lily James), tries to do one last job to leave his life of crime, but like most one last jobs, it doesnt quite work outYou want excitement? You want fun? Do you want one of the best movies youll see this year? Then you need to get behind the wheel, drive to the nearest theater and see Baby Driver. Its a simple tale told with masterful moviemaking magic and fresh, frenetic flavor from writer/director Edgar Wright. Wright has taken everything he learned from Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and The Worlds End and elevated it all into something incredible. Baby Driver is an idea hes had gestating for over twenty years, and you can see every carefully crafted inch of the film reflects his passion, tenacity, and well, drive in making this a modern genre mashup between music video, gangster film, action movie, and fairy tale. That sounds like a mishmosh but trust me, it all flawlessly gels together into something unbelievably special. Wright has always had a talent for blending music and the moving picture, but hes molded it into something completely new with Baby Driver. The movie never ceases to have a rhythm and a beat to it. You could spend the entire running time tapping your toes along to the insanely energetic soundtrack. Seriously, this album is going to be this years Awesome Mix. Vol. 1. But its not only the music that makes Baby Driver such a delight. Youve got a cast that is having the time of their lives. Ansel Elgort is perfect as Baby. You might notice that he has a Han Solo-esque jacket on during the movie, and I kind of wish he was playing the legendary smuggler in the new Han Solo film. Hes that good. Lily James is equally captivating as Debora, and the two have such great chemistry that it would make Walter White smile. The rest of the cast is rounded out by dependable character actors; Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm, Jon Bernthal, and Elza Gonzlez make up the kind of iconic gangster squad that makes this class of movie shine. And to top it all off, the movie doesnt skimp on the script. This is a tightly told contemporary fable thats as classic as it is innovative. Wright injects humor and pathos in all the right doses so that this doesnt become a style-over-substance glitter piece. Every character is fully formed and gets their moment in the sun. The emotional payoffs are a knockout across the board and will have you invested and engaged at every twist and turn. Youll be shocked, tense, excited, and overjoyed by the time the house lights come up. Its a rollercoaster ride thats going at lightspeed. It is everything you want from a night at the movies. Fast-paced story, heart-pounding action, swoonworthy romance, colorful characters, laughs, gasps, tears, and triumph. Baby Driver is this years Mad Max: Fury Road: a game-changer of unfettered style that will go on to inspire future filmmakers. Undoubtedly, Baby Driver is the best film of the year. It will take a gargantuan achievement to knock it from that spot. As of now, 2017 has found its cinematic champion."
SSM_Doc3_BabyDriver,SSM,Action,Positive,Baby Driver,"The Fault in Our Stars star Ansel Elgort is the title character, an orphaned get-a-way driver with tinnitus who owes gang boss Doc (Kevin Spacey) a favour. Baby wants out of the life of crime and into the arms of diner waitress Debora (Lily James). Before they can run off to the happily-ever-after, however, he must square his debt with the older gangster. The gangster uses different crews for every robbery, but Baby is always the driver because hes Mozart in a Go Cart. He had an accident when he was a kid, says Doc. Still has a hum in the drum. Plays music to drown it out. And thats what makes him the best. With his debt cleared after a wild and woolly robbery, Doc makes Baby an offer he cant refuse, a gig doing another get-a-way job. Its a job he cant turn down. Whats it going to be? Doc asks, behind the wheel or in a wheelchair? One more job and were straight, says Doc. Now I dont think I need to give you the speech about what would happen if you say no, how I could break your legs and kill everyone you love because you already know that, dont you? Teaming up with an unhinged band of baddies, Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza Gonzalez) and loose cannon Bats (Jamie Foxx), Baby soon discovers this heist is not like any that came before. Perhaps its because he now has Deborah on his mind, or perhaps its because his partners-in-crime are a few spark plugs short of an engine block. Even when there are no cars on screen (which isnt very often) Baby Driver is in motion. Working with Sia choreographer Ryan Heffington, Wright has created a stylized dance between his camera and actors. Its frenetic, melodic and just a dance step or two away from being the worlds first car chase musical. Elgort is the engine that drives the movie. With dark Ray Bans and tousled hair he recalls Tom Cruise in Risky Business. His character has suffered great loss and copes by thrill chasing set to a soundtrack provided by stolen iPods. Baby doesnt say muchYou know why they call him Baby, right? says Buddy. Still waiting on his first words.but the character takes a journey, physical and metaphysical. He has a wide arc summed up by the old clich action speak louder than words. Spacey is more verbose. He plays Doc as a gangster who talks like a character out of a Raymond Chandler movie. Instead of get rid of the car, Doc instructs Baby to sunset that car. Its a small but important role that adds flair and some laughs to the film. James is all sweetness and light as Debora, a woman whose life is changed in the space of just a few days. Hamm, Foxx and Gonzlez, meanwhile, bring various levels of badassery to contrast Babys ever-developing sense of morality. The movies tone is light, but this isnt an outright comedy like Wrights other films. Hamm and Foxx toss off the odd funny line but both bring the fire when necessary, bringing a kinetic undertone of danger to every scene theyre in. Baby Driver succumbs to clich near the end but for most of its running time is an exhilarating ride, fuelled by a tank full of adrenaline."
SSM_Doc4_BabyDriver,SSM,Action,Positive,Baby Driver,"To repay a debt, a young man must play the part of a getaway driver for a theft ringleader and his gang of criminals. Relying on his music to aid in his misadventures. While he sees his illegal career coming to an end soon, his boss has other plans. Written and directed by Edgar Wright, best known for his Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, Baby Driver is a nonstop ride from start to finish, thats equal parts hilarious as it is thrilling. As a child, Baby (Ansel Elgort) lost both his parents in a terrible car accident that left him with a permanent ring in both ears. He developed a strong passion for music as a way to drown out the hum, living his life to a soundtrack he has created. While getting into a bit of trouble in his early years, he caught the attention of Doc (Kevin Spacey), whos the mastermind behind robberies in the Atlanta area. With a debt owed to Doc, Baby becomes his getaway driver for his revolving door of thieves. Hes great at what he does, but he has what the others dont, which is a conscience. A life of crime is obviously not for him. With an end in sight for Baby, he falls for a waitress named Debora (Lily James), who shares the same love for music as he does. As their budding romance blossoms, the looming threat of Doc and his crew hangs over Baby as hes drawn in for one more, and hopefully final, job. Starting off without missing a beat, Baby Driver instantly throws you into the action of an intense robbery. The film is filled with so many amazing action sequences and insane stunt driving, which keeps the audiences engaged and on the edge of their seat the whole time. Its a movie made for the big screen and one that leaves you with a rush. And while it certainly feeds that desire for fast-paced action, dont be fooled into thinking this flick is just one dimensional. The humor is top notch throughout, not surprising for Wright, who has crafted some of the best comedies, including one of my personal favorites, Shaun of the Dead. Perfectly blending wit into a film with some serious themes, in a way that doesnt feel cheap nor turns everything into a punchline. Some of that humor coming from Babys relationship with his elderly and deaf foster dad. Which brought an entire other level of heart to the movie. Rounding out the film are Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Jon Bernthal and Eiza Gonzlez. While the cast undoubtedly delivers great performances, and Wrights screenplay is a masterpiece, it is the soundtrack that will stick with you. One that could rival Guardians of the Galaxy in how its a character on its own. Breathing a totally different life to the film. Elgort essentially costars with the musical tracks and his charisma shines through each scene. Its one of the best aspects to the entire film. Honestly, its impossible to find flaws within this movie as it so perfectly delivers in all facets. The thrills and laughs never cease and its no wonder the film has been the most buzzed about throughout the film festival season. Which saw its release date bumped from August to June, placing it right in that summer movie peak spot. Its a film that is so easily enjoyable for everyone and one of the best of the year."
SSM_Doc5_BabyDriver,SSM,Action,Positive,Baby Driver,"Its been four long years since Edgar Wright painted the screen with one of his funny, stylish and wildly entertaining pieces of cinema, his last being The Worlds End (unless you want to count Ant-Man), and Baby Driver proves to be a welcome addition to his already impressive catalogue. Fueled by a never-ending, always-fresh soundtrack, this kinetic action-musical is undoubtedly one of the coolest movies youll see this year and is one that demands to be seen on the big screen. (My wife and I were lucky enough to catch it in a Dolby Cinema theater.) The film blasts off right from the start by introducing us to protagonist Baby, played by Ansel Elgort, doing what he does best: driving. Set to the tune of Bellbottoms by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, we are introduced to Baby using his music as a conduit for his skilled driving, which entails out maneuvering every cop that comes his way, in the opening scene. This blistering introduction sets the stage for the unique relationship the soundtrack has with the film, and makes for its most unique and endearing quality. Babys motley crew of thieves  Buddy, Bats, Darling and Griff  are played by Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Eiza Gonzlez and Jon Bernthal, respectively, and Kevin Spacey plays Doc, the leader of the group and the man who keeps Baby under his thumb. With the exception of Spaceys Doc, who can be maniacal and heartless one moment and then act as a father figure the next, the others come off as basic, one-note thugs, aided only by Wrights clever dialogue. Elgorts Baby plays like a slightly less stoic version of Ryan Gosling in Drive, speaking only when he must and showing little emotion. His constant need for music stems from the tinnitus he sustained after a horrific car accident that claimed the lives of his parents. He only begins coming out of his shell after meeting Debora, played by Lily James, a server at the diner he frequents. Like so many of these movies go, however, their new love is threatened when Baby is brought back into a life of crime for just one more job. Narratively speaking, theres not really much going on in Baby Driver. The film hops back and forth from heist to love story a few times; then its over. Each segment is so well executed, however, that the slight plot feels entirely inconsequential. The first two acts are such a thrill though that it leaves the latter half looking noticeably weaker. Because Baby is constantly listening to his iPod, we, by proxy, are as well. Theres a constant symmetry between the visuals and music, and this is a mechanic that never gets old and transforms what amounts to an above-average heist flick into something much more. Baby Driver is Edgar Wrights love letter to music, framed within a glorious heist film. It shows us we should always carry our own playlists, though maybe not so obsessively, and allow music to fuel our creativity. Now this is one musical I can get behind."
SSM_Doc6_BabyDriver,SSM,Action,Negative,Baby Driver,"BABY DRIVER is quite frustrating because the driving scenes are impressively shot (although they dont feature any cool cars, something that films of this ilk SHOULD do) and there is at least one terrific joke involving Michael Myers Halloween masks, as a whole the script doesnt add up to a cohesive story. The laughs are few and far between and the women in the filmJames as the waitress and Eiza Gonzalez as Jon Hamms love interestare treated as little more than McGuffins, setting events in order while wearing cute little outfits and not given much else to do. The supporting cast turns in some good performances as crime story caricaturesFoxx as the loose cannon, Spacey as the father figure boss manbut Jon Hamm shines. with those good looks and natural charisma, which, by the third act twist that reveals him as a much more dastardly villain, its quite easy for the audience to sympathize with him and want to see Buddy emerge victorious. Its a misstep in a script that feels like it needed one more draft. Crime stories like this are chock full of dirt bags, anti-heroes, and honorable thieves, but BABY DRIVER goes to great lengths to inform the audience that Baby isnt as bad as these other guys, but he kind of is. Its cloying and unfortunately inline with the rest of the script that feels like a teenage boys fantasy. Perhaps Im a cynic, but a character that falls in love that quickly doesnt seem romantic to me, it comes across as juvenile. The film gets into trouble when it shifts in tone from a brutal action film to a cutesy romance that doesnt really work. Wright should have looked to Manns THIEF which painted a similar character in Frank who thought that having a wife and kid would put everything straight and learned that it doesnt change a thing. The films script also seems to drop a gunfight in the middle (with a criminally underused Paul Williams) simply because there needed to be an action beat. The film could have been improved with a more charismatic lead. Unfortunately Elgort doesnt do much more than mope around like a lovesick teenager and doesnt endear himself to the audience but its difficult to tell if thats because of him or the script. He certainly is more boring to watch than any of his cohorts. Seeing his character bump into extras on the street because hes not paying attention is sure to infuriate anyone who has been walking to work through a major metropolitan area. In the past, Edgar Wright has a displayed a knack for deftly balancing genre parody and reinvention: SHAUN OF THE DEAD took on zombie films, HOT FUZZ 90s action cinema, and THE WORLDS END combined an alien invasion film with THE BIG CHILL. BABY DRIVER should be a clever dissection of man-with-no-name style action cinema in the vein of Walter Hills THE DRIVER and Nicolas Winding Refns neo neon-noir DRIVE, but a half-baked, juvenile script doesnt bring any pathos to the flashy film. BABY DRIVER seems like a missed opportunity. All the pieces are there, but nothing really comes together. While there are some impressive action beats, the hollowness of the whole thing is overbearing. Plenty of great action films are shallowtake for instance the FAST AND THE FURIOUS series or Michael Bays 90s outputwith on the nose, surface level drama, BABY DRIVER just feels like a sugary shell with nothing in side. Its too cutesy to be Walter Hill-esque, too juvenile to be Mannsploitation, and not sleazy enough to be compared to Shane Black, but not original enough to be categorized as its own thing."
SSM_Doc7_BabyDriver,SSM,Action,Negative,Baby Driver,"The star, ace getaway driver Baby (Ansel Elgort), waits behind the wheel for his crew to finish robbing a bank. He cranks up Bellbottoms on the iPod and commences rocking out. He grooves, sings into a water bottle, and generally loses himself in music bliss, not missing a beat when the crew charges back into the car and they burn rubber. The meshing of the songs raw squalling power and the chases visual velocity is cinematic TNT. Wright was right on that one. But while the whole sequence would have made an MTV Award-worthy video, its not much to build an entire movie on. The Beastie Boys Sabotage was cool, but they didnt create a feature around it. Thats not to say that Baby Driver doesnt have its charms, even if theyre somewhat faded with all the influences they wear so heavily. Baby works for Doc (Kevin Spacey) an underworld heavyweight who is essentially President Francis J. Underwood with a whiteboard, trench coat, shotgun, and slightly higher morals. He puts together high-stakes heists with a rotating cast of Tarantino-lite gunsels like the overtly sociopathic Bats (Jamie Foxx, sporting a tattoo of a bat on his neck and a crazy-eyed stare) and the covertly sociopathic Buddy (Jon Hamm) but prefers his Baby at the wheel. Doc, whose stone-cold heart warms just the slightest when it comes to Baby, defends his out-there driver a good kid and a devil behind the wheel. Those two characteristics are pretty much all that we get on Baby (B-A-B-Y? people ask incredulously). Wright has written him as a high-functioning autist who loves driving and listening to music, preferably doing those together. Imagine if Ryan Goslings character from Drive had a thing for air guitar, and youre partway there. Theres an origin story for all of this, dealt out in flashbacks that are just a little too on the nose  traumatic memories from his childhood involving parents, music, and driving  to have much emotional impact. The movie keeps telling us that Baby has problems dealing with the world and can only cope by wearing sunglasses, not speaking, and driving with a stream of painstakingly curated music pumping through his earbuds. But Elgorts easygoing charisma and Babys surprising ease talking to just about anybody when required makes short work of the whole conceit; hes less the Rainman of Getaway Drivers than he is a music-obsessed young adult who keeps to himself and wears sunglasses indoors. Hardly as off-putting as the other characters keep making it out to be. Wright also cant stop hammering home the good kid aspect. He not only gives Baby an old deaf man (CJ Jones), his foster father, to care for, but a puppy dog romance with a curly-haired waitress named Debora (Lily James) who is so bright-eyed she appears to be auditioning for Glinda in a roadshow production of Wicked. This is at heart a one-last-job story about the prototypical good kid trying to get out of the criminal life with his body, soul, and conscience (not to mention those of his foster father and new girlfriend) fully intact. But to do that, he has to pull a bigger-than-usual job with Doc and abscond with all his loot before the ever-paranoid crew is any the wiser. Yes, thats about as hoary a clich as there is. But when one-last-job movies are done right, watching the hero juggle the Rube Goldberg machinery of competing interests amidst the threaded arcs of guilt, redemption, loyalty, and utopian dreaming can be intoxicating in a pulpy kind of way."
SSM_Doc8_BabyDriver,SSM,Action,Negative,Baby Driver,"Edgar Wright is back in action movie mode for Baby Driver, a crime caper just slightly enough on the offbeat side enough to stand out among the summer franchise entries. Ansel Elgort stars as Baby (no, seriously), a iPod-attached getaway driver wrapping up an undefined debt to his somewhat paternal boss Doc (Kevin Spacey). There is Wright-ian wit to spare in the set pieces and characterizations as Baby wraps up his final mission and falls for waitress Debora (Lily James), but Driver is also his messiest. With a solid supporting ensemble that features a delightfully unhinged Jamie Foxx and Spacey on his more understated side of hammy, the film is nevertheless a great launching pad for Ansel Elgort as a multitalented leading man. While the film is as lively as anything else Edgar Wright has done, it is also his most anonymous. With all the scattered pacing and barrage of images thrown at the audience, there is not much point of view to the action or confidence in its ability to thrill us without breaking our necks. Here Wright trades in his emphasis on connection and relationships for a loud pastiche, missing the heart that has made his previous rounds of cinematic anarchy so memorable. Driver is less precise and more surface, without much  of a human entry point to make this fit in with his stronger work. For a film that desperately throws everything on that screen, it leaves you wanting quite a bit more. The film at least comes with good intentions, so its not the kind of cynical chore you might expect. The action is fully realized with seemingly few CGI bells and whistles, so its rooted in some semblance of reality to balance out Wrights verbal and physical outlandishness. Had it been more controlled in its freneticism, you might get to actually feel more of its unfussy rush and wit. Much will be made of the films literally non-stop soundtrack. But even the music cues feel labored, an attempt to stamp the film with an air of cool that feels mannered no matter how much it clearly comes from a place of love. The sheer endlessness of the songs in the film kills its own intended effect - rather than flashes of inspiration, it eventually fades into this loud and busy tapestry. Drivers biggest delight is Baby himself - Ansel Elgort maximizes his matinee idol cache here in a role that allows him to charm the house down with sweetness, stoicism, and the odd dance routine or two. Wrights protagonists are often his least interesting characters, but Elgorts is compelling in both his physicality and nuanced tension. We will see how far out he might be from superstardom, but a significant musical role cant be far off with moves like these. The real chutzpah can be found in some early tracking shots where Wright and Elgort get to really shine in this heightened reality, with slinky choreography and popping visual charisma. Here Wright effectively gets at both who Baby is and what his film aspires to be, in both establishing this original enigmatic hero and its soulful musical identity. This breezy confidence holds all of the films blended genres in a more rewarding way than all of the bluster surrounding it."
SSM_Doc9_BabyDriver,SSM,Action,Negative,Baby Driver,"Thanks to an error in judgment, Baby (the main character in the new thriller Baby Driver) drives getaway cars for a soft-spoken but ruthless Atlanta crime boss who's skilled at staging robberies. When I saw the trailer for director Edgar Wright's movie, I got excited. Maybe we could add something with real kick to the summer slag heap. But Wright (Shaun of the Dead) has made a movie that's mostly froth, a crime fantasy posing as a thriller with hard-boiled performances from a cast that includes Kevin Spacey (as a no-nonsense criminal mastermind); Jamie Foxx (as a psychopathic thief); John Hamm (as an exiled Wall Street wheeler-dealer); and Eliza Gonzalez (as the girlfriend of Hamm's character). None of these characters show much by way of originality; Spacey's performance feels like a bit of a reiteration. As is often the case, he's playing the smartest, meanest guy in the room. Hamm actually was scarier as a ruthless ad man in Mad Men. Here, you get the feeling that he's trying too hard to pull out all the stops. If Wright wanted a baby-faced character to play Baby, he could have done no better than Ansel Elgort, who has the kind of face that registers boyish innocence. Elgort never loses our sympathy. So here's the gimmick: Elgort's Baby carries multiple iPods, each loaded with music to fit whatever mood or pursuit in which he happens to find himself. Music also drowns out the hum of tinnitus from which he suffers, a malady acquired in a car accident in which, as a child, he lost his parents. Baby is devoted to the memory of his late mother, a singer by trade. He's been raised by a foster parent (CJ Jones), an aging deaf man for whom the adult Baby has become chief caretaker. A ton of music turns Baby Driver into a juke box of a movie featuring tunes from a variety of artists, spanning numerous pop styles. We're talking Blur, R.E.M, Barry White, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, Queen and more. Baby lives behind a set of earphones. Wright leavens the proceedings with romance. Baby falls for a waitress (Lily James). Baby indulges a cornball dream in which the two of them will hit the open road with nothing but music, each other and an endless horizon of new possibilities. Naturally, Doc opposes Baby's departure from the group of rotating felons who carry out his intricate plans. Doc sees Baby as his good-luck charm. He won't let him go. If you like car chases, you'll get your fill, but for me, even creatively handled car chases have diminishing returns. Here's another movie in which shifting gears becomes a metaphor for assertive expression. Of all the performances, Foxx's proves the most unsettling. His character -- named Bats -- suggests real danger, as opposed to the kind of faux, pulpy menace everyone else exudes. If you've seen movies by Quentin Tarantino or Nicolas Winding (Drive), you may find a glib familiarity in Wright's movie, a sense of amoral hipness that, like one of the tires in this film, seems to be losing tread from wear. For all its attempts at juxtaposing Baby's sweet dreams with the hard-core aspirations of the movie's band of miscreants, Baby Driver has no more staying power than an air kiss. The longer it goes on, the more fleeting its fleetness becomes."
SSM_Doc10_BabyDriver,SSM,Action,Negative,Baby Driver,"Getaway driver Baby (Ansel Elgort, The Divergent Series: Allegiant) has to do one more job for Doc (Kevin Spacey, Netflixs House of Cards), then hes out of the heist game. Just as he plans to run away with waitress Debora (Lily James, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies), Doc makes it plain: he and Baby are now straight, but Babys not out. Instead, Baby has to team up with Buddy (Jon Hamm, Keeping Up with the Joneses), Darling (Eiza Gonzlez, TVs From Dusk Till Dawn) and Bats (Jamie Foxx, Annie) to rob a post office. Baby has tinnitus from a car crash, and he constantly listens to music to drown it out. Baby Driver is set to the soundtrack of Babys life, which suspiciously thematically matches the action on screen. Wright devised the film around the soundtrack, and on the nose is often the phrase best used to describe the effect. A prime example of this is something being wrong with Baby, and Baby walks into a diner that is playing When Something Is Wrong With My Baby. Its an incredibly literal film in this sense. Wrights commitment to diegetic music makes this seem far more contrived than if he had just overlaid music on scenes; in this regard, Baby Driver is the opposite number to Suicide Squad, but Baby Driver has the smugness of an auteur rather than the self-satisfaction of a committee. Wright often cant decide whether the music is instrumental or ornamental, and the mix never quite works  and nothing makes sense about gun shots in time to music. If you cant tell at any given moment if a director is aiming for realism or stylised action, its possible the director cant either. In Wrights defence, however, he does know how to choreograph an action sequence on wheels. Babys stunts seem as if they would be effective in affecting a getaway from a crime scene. Due to his slavish adherence to the music, the scenes on foot work less well: in a rare running chase scene, a chair is clearly on screen just so that Elgort has something to jump over. It doesnt make sense and lacks visual flair. Though Wright has assembled an ensemble of some renown, he has them lead by an actor who is traditionally a black hole for personality and chemistry. Though Elgorts complete lack of affect is built into the character, its difficult to care for him; that he falls in love with Debora not only because shes there but because she reminds him of his late mother adds layers of meaning youd rather not think about in an action movie. Luckily, James is good, and Foxx is loathsome in an intentional way. Hamm and Gonzlez have a strange but effective chemistry, although Hamm ends up having to chew his way through some of the most deliberately(?) awful action-movie patter since the nineties. Spacey just comes across as smug, and, like the film that surrounds him, hes written completely inconsistently. Baby Driver is very much the sort of film that youre either instantly onside with or off. The problem is that if you love the music and its synchronicity with the action on screen, theres probably just not going to be enough off it; if you cant stand the opening, theres going to be just enough of that sort of stuff to turn you off a film that can never quite decide what gear its in. Baby Driver is too much the soulless good boy doing bad things; what it lacks in substance it cant hope to make up for in style."
SSC_Doc1_The Conjuring 3,SSC,Horror,Positive,The Conjuring 3,"I was ready to write off the so-called Conjuring Universe. The original Conjuring movie was great, and The Conjuring 2was pretty decent. The Annabelle pictures, on the other hand, didn't do much for me. As for The Nun, the less said the better. Paranormal chiller elements were becoming recycled to the point of impotency in the series. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It wisely goes in a new direction, shifting into full-on occult horror mode. Nothing about this franchise is likely to ever match the original. This is a satisfying scare show nonetheless.Loosely based on a true story, the film finds Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) looking into a potential case of demonic possession. They attend the exorcism of 8-year-old David Glatzel (Julien Hilliard). During the procedure, Ed sees the demon transfer into the body of David's sister's boyfriend, Arne Johnson (Ruairi O'Connor). Soon after, Arne commits a heinous murder, seemingly against his will. He believes  as do the Warrens  that he was driven to the act by a satanic force beyond his control.A few scenes in the movie involve the legal efforts to claim demonic possession as a defense in court, to prevent Arne from getting the death penalty. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It doesn't have much interest in being a legal drama, though. Instead, it follows Ed and Lorraine as they attempt to determine where the demon came from. Their search begins in the crawlspace under the Glatzel home and gradually takes them to more and more sinister places. The previous Conjuring films relied on two things: the scary stuff and the relationship between the Warrens. Nothing in this new installment is as terrifying as the hide and seek sequence from the original. Then again, few things are. Director Michael Chaves (The Curse of La Llorona) crafts a number of pleasingly eerie scenes anyway. A bit involving David and a waterbed is terrifically spooky, as is a bit with Lorraine using her psychic gifts to put herself at the scene of another, related murder. All the stops get pulled out for the climactic confrontation with the entity responsible for the evil proceedings, too.In regard to the central characters, The Devil Made Me Do It develops them in an unexpected, yet gratifying manner. Ed suffers a heart attack (not a spoiler) and is temporarily wheelchair-bound, meaning Lorraine has to take a bigger role. She works with a police detective to help find a missing girl. Later, a trip to the morgue causes her to put herself into great peril by becoming vulnerable to the demon. During these and other situations, Ed has to sit back and worry. He can't be beside her like normal, a fact that makes him nervous. Wilson and Farmiga really dive into that dynamic, showing how not being a fully functional unit impacts the couple. 
A few scenes in the film border on being a little silly and  on first viewing, at least  some plot holes exist during the third act. Seeing the Warrens try to make the case for Arne's possession on the witness stand also would have been a welcome addition. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It doesn't hit the highs that James Wan's original did. It does, however, make an intriguing case for the possibility of satanic influence in our world. A key tenet of this series has always been that believing in good means believing in evil. This time, that idea is honed in further to suggest that believing in God means believing in Satan. And if Satan can do what he did to Arne, we're going to need God more than ever. A horror movie unafraid to ponder such big ideas is definitely something to be grateful for."
SSC_Doc2_The Conjuring 3,SSC,Horror,Positive,The Conjuring 3,"Stepping away from the haunted house style that weve seen in the first two movies, The Devil Made Me Do It is based on the horrific court story of Arne Cheyenne Johnson. After he killed his landlord in 1981, Arne wanted to prove his innocence by claiming that he was possessed during the violent altercation. It was a major documented media event in the US at the time, simply because nothing like this had ever happened before. At the centre of all of this, attempting to help Arne is none other than the legendary paranormal investigators, Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga).
After a whirlwind introduction that fans of The Exorcist will really appreciate, and discovering that Arne has been cursed, our paranormal duo goes on a trip through demonic obsession, in a race against time to try and support his alibi. Battling against The Occultist (Eugenie Bondurant), they march through psychotic mind games and nightmarish monsters to find answers. Between the court case plot, that Ruairi O'Connor holds up well, and those popcorn-throwing scares that The Conjuring fans are now used to coming from The Occultist, The Devil Made Me Do It quickly becomes a fun and intriguing horror. We also get a look into the history of our paranormal heroes, which firmly connects the trilogy.Alongside sleek acting work from the core cast members, it would criminal to not mention John Nobles take on Kastner. Just like weve seen John do in shows like Fringe, his character dances around crucial answers, that the audience wants, right up until the time is exactly right.Looking at the bonus features, theres a section of small (A die-hard fan might be after a little bit more content), but informative interviews from the main cast and crew. From directors Michael Chaves and James Wan, right through to the acting leads themselves its a quick look at what happened behind the scenes. Potentially, the most interesting part is when we see the real-life Arne Johnson and his late wife Debbie Glatzel, who both explain that surreal story, and what it was like to be involved with this project. Also, the audio comic and content about how the exorcism opening came together, add more background to what youve watched.Its obvious that Michael Chaves has really tried to do something different in this third outing. Instead of playing it safe by repeating that tried and tested Conjuring formula (Which works well!) he has given us a twisted, paranormal adventure that focuses on a savage, real-life court case, that also puts our leads in unfamiliar, yet testing terrain. After an ending that echoes The Shining, and once those unsettling credits finish, you might well find yourself further researching this huge paranormal universe, and of course, the Arne Johnson case itself. Many franchises are known for struggling on that third movie, but because of The Devil Made Me Do It, we now have another fantastic horror trilogy.I watched this with my 16-year-old son and we liked it, peeking through our fingers and laughing in equal measure."
SSC_Doc3_The Conjuring 3,SSC,Horror,Positive,The Conjuring 3,"Three movies in, plus four spinoff films and more on the way, and The Conjuring franchise is losing some of its luster. The original director, James Wan, is still involved in an advisory capacity but his absence is felt in the director's chair, not that The Devil Made Me Do It is poorly directed by Michael Chaves (Curse of La Llorona), but it's starting to feel stale. The Warrens (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) are a husband-and-wife team of paranormal investigators traveling the country and solving 1970s/80s mysteries. This third entry feels the most like an expanded episode from a TV series, like X-Files, and maybe that's because of its inherently procedural nature. The Warrens are defending a young man accused of murder but who says, as the subtitle describes, that he is not guilty by reason of demonic possession. From there, the Warrens are investigating to prove the demon exists and then trace its demonic history. The scares are low although the intensity feels cranked just as high; there are lots of scenes of gale force winds, shattered windows, characters yelling, and loud music. I miss the perfectly executed Old School horror sequences that were the hallmark of the earlier movies. It set up its rules, wound up the scene, and you just squirmed in anticipation. This franchise has never been revolutionary but more an expertly polished and honed tension machine. However, when the calibrations are off, then the franchise has even less going for it. There are some interesting ideas and elements, like Lorraine (Farmiga) being able to see from the eyes of the demonic killer, but the franchise feels more repetitive and stalled, with multiple exorcisms and Ed (Wilson)'s health being a motivating factor for his wife to prevent, again. The supporting characters are bland or broad and the mystery itself isn't that interesting, nor is the ultimate villain. In the realm of Conjuring as weekly TV show formula, this feels like an acceptable middle episode with the expectations that they can improve the next week. The ""based on true cases"" selling point is also starting to grate in light of the reality that a man blamed his own actions on the devil and these controversial people sought to exonerate a murderer. The real-life version is morally abhorrent. The junky horror version can work as long as it doesn't take itself too seriously. If the other Conjuring movies were gourmet entries, then this is more the fast food version. It may still satisfy fans but it's definitely not as well made and with questionable ingredients.I have always loved the conjuring series and every single movie of it has never disappointed me ever. I just hope they keep making conjuring movies because everyone loves and yeah the critics are just crazy so don't listen to them.Another solid outing from the franchise! Watchable, enjoyable and the universe building is effective - the added 'ring of truth' with artistic is license is solid without over egging it.Brilliant movie best one yet"
SSC_Doc4_The Conjuring 3,SSC,Horror,Positive,The Conjuring 3,"Its 1981 and what starts as yet another routine exorcism for the demonologist couple Ed and Lorraine, quickly turns into a nasty surprise. A powerful demon, out to claim the soul of the 12-year-old David (Julian Hilliard) is a formidable force that can do the unthinkable. When a young man Arne (Ruairi O'Connor) challenges it to leave David and enter him, things quickly start spiraling out of control. Now, its up to Ed and Lorraine to save Arne and themselves from this unhallowed possession.This is the third and overall eighth installment of the Conjuring universe. Based on a real incident, which became a landmark case in the history of the American judiciary, this installment delves deep into the dark and crime-infested world of a sinister spirit, like never before.Of course, all good things from the Conjuring hall of fame are firmly in place and theres a lot more. Like, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, the driving forces of this powerful franchise are once again, in their element. Wilson is incredible as Ed Warren and delivers a familiarly restrained performance. But Farmiga gets to go the extra mile here, giving us an emotional peek into Lorraines strength and vulnerability. This lends so much relatability and heft to the overall narrative, despite all the cinematic liberties. Its driven from Ed and more so from Lorraines perspective rather than the possessed.It wouldnt be an overstatement to say that this is by far the best Conjuring installment. Its not just scary but full of unpredictable twists and turns. Once again, Conjuring is breaking new grounds by mixing two genres  horror and crime, so seamlessly.Taking off from a real-life incident, writers David Leslie Johnson and James Wan smartly turn it into a thrilling murder mystery. A gripping screenplay, unravelling a deeply disturbing trend in a sleepy town, is as eerie as it gets. And as the Warrens venture into the unknown, they take the audience along. Johnson and Wans incredible quality of writing as seen in hits like Orphan and SAW, is quite evident.The films direction by Michael Chaves is surreal and exquisite that brings alive scene after scene, building tension and thrill along the way. He ditches the typical horror-like jumpscares for legit storytelling. Its a huge improvement from Michael Chavess last direction The Curse of La Llorona. While its a first for a Conjuring franchise film to not be directed by James Wan, Michael Chaves ensures he wont be missed. The cinematography and the background score are immersive, just like the plot. The edit is sharp and fast-paced.Theres hardly a dull moment in The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. This one takes the franchise to newer highs revealing a chilling story of terror, murders and the unknown evil. The Conjuring films arent documentaries, so they have always taken liberties with the facts  the first film remaining closest to reality  just as Friedkin did to create his horror masterpiece. In Devil the story involves creepy looking witch totems (napkin holders from the Hardesty Collection, not available at Target), an occultist (Eugenie Bondurant) who looks like she time traveled from Salem in the 1600s, and an ode to the The Shining during the big finale. Chaves keeps the mood tense while fabricating real scares and dropping levity at just the right moment making The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It a worthy entry in the franchise."
SSC_Doc5_The Conjuring 3,SSC,Horror,Positive,The Conjuring 3,"While The Conjuring franchise has stood as one of the most successful and impressive horror series from the past few decades, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It had enough on paper to put the status of the sequel in question. Coming as the third film in the main series, the film ditched the legendary James Wan as director with Michael Chaves instead stepping up to the role after his work on 2019's The Curse of La Llorona which is universally known as one of the worst editions in the cinematic universe. With a shaky main trailer and this change in crew, it was natural to feel iffy walking into the film only for it to surprise greatly with a unique yet captivating story that built on the strengths of the franchise to confidently find a fresh and new direction.Throughout nearly every film within this cinematic universe, one of the brightest spots of the universe has been the cinematic portrayals of The Warrens played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. With an undeniable chemistry and charm, these two have been the blood and soul of the franchise with The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It putting this relationship front and center within the film's drama and focus. As the couple investigates a mysterious case of possession, they find themselves hunted and targeted with the stakes being more personal than ever. The drive from each actor and character to protect the other and make it out of the situation alive is more than enough to hook the audience and give the film a unique sense of humanity and drama. Where there are still demons and possession around nearly every corner, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It has a unique threat that is far more grounded in the human world which gives an incredibly unique dynamic to the tension and horror within the film. In this sense, the film has to be considered a massive success for Michael Chaves who clearly put a unique touch on the feature that at times feels bold and confident. Chaves isn't simply trying to recreate the magic James Wan brought to the earlier editions of the series but rather is trying to evolve the material and film to stand on its own. Where this switch in focus does provide some of the strongest moments of the film, it also can cause a sense of disruption within the soul of the movie. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It often sides more with the identity of a mystery crime thriller than a jumpscare horror film with the movie never fully willing to completely reinvent itself. Where there are some more horrifying sequences towards the end that naturally build and fit into the film's narrative, the majority of the jumpscare sequences to come before the closing feel really out of place and forced. Clearly the film was worried about losing the core audience that has come to love the terrifying horror up to this point and included these scenes to cheaply attempt to please these fans despite not really making sense in the context of the film. These scenes stand out not just due to the more messy attempts to write them into the narrative but also due to the lesser quality of horror in which they feature. Unlike the wind-up box of the first film or any of the gimmicks within the second, the aesthetic and gimmicks within this feature are instantly forgettable and overall feel lackluster. Where the other Conjuring films from the main series has truly struck a sense of terror within audiences, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It fails to come close to achieving this but considering its focus is in a different place, that isn't nearly as damming as a statement as it might seem. 
Where The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It might not be the most horrifying edition in the Conjuring franchise and universe, it still is a rather successful film taking a more personable and grounded approach that will suck audiences in for a fun yet thrilling adventure held together by likable characters and an overarching theme of love. Where some diehard fans of the franchise might reject this new direction, for plenty it will prove effective and it seems like even with Wan stepping away from the franchise he has worked to build the franchise has the potential to continue to give worthwhile sequels and battles with the paranormal."
SSC_Doc6_The Conjuring 3,SSC,Horror,Negative,The Conjuring 3,"Ed and Lorraine Warren were Roman Catholics who claimed to be a demonologist and clairvoyant/light trance medium respectively.  They were paranormal investigators who were involved with numerous hauntings/possessions that took place in the 1970s and '80s.  While many chose to believe in their special ""talents"" others were quick to debunk their claims.  Over the years, much of their work laid the foundation for a few horror movies, including The Amityville Horror franchise and most recently, The Conjuring movies including their ""spin-offs"" Annabelle and The Nun.  This week the third Conjuring installment, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It heads to stores on Blu-ray, 4K UHD, and digital download. It was 1981 in Brookfield, Connecticut.  Eight-year-old David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard; The Haunting of Hill House) is supposedly possessed by a demon and Ed (Patrick Wilson; Aquaman) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga; Up In the Air) Warren are there to witness the exorcism.  During the event, David's sister's fianc, Arne Johnson (Ruari O'Connor; Teen Spirit) invites the demon into his body to save David.  Ed watches the demon possess Arne but has a heart attack and is comatose for a month.  Once he awakens, he tells Lorraine what he witnessed, and she warns the police.  However, it is too late as Arne has killed his landlord.  At his trial, Arne pleads not guilty and tries to use demonic possession as a defense.Based on a true story, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, once again pairs Wilson and Farmiga as the paranormal investigators.  As we have seen in the previous two films, they have great chemistry which makes their story of husband and wife believable.  Hilliard, for being young, does a great job while given the difficult task of playing a child possessed.  O'Connor offers the look and feel of a young man who truly has no idea what happened to him that would make him want to kill his landlord and Eugenie Bondurant (The Hunger Games: Mockingjay) is mesmerizing at the Occultist, a character that enters the story later in the movie.  
Directed by Michael Chaves (The Curse of La Llorona), the third installment in The Conjuring series offers much of the same look and feel as the first two films while not necessarily being quite as scary.  The push/pull connection between Lorraine and the Occultist is interesting and makes the story more enjoyable.  The two women, Farmiga and Bondurant, have strong presences on screen, and watching them play off one another is a treat.  
The 2160p high-definition resolution of the 4K disc shows in-depth details, especially when Ed and Lorraine discover the totems.  These little statues are intricately detailed which is showcased beautifully in 4K.  Like most horror movies, the film is dark lighting-wise, but the 4K version has deeper black tones and truer colors than the standard Blu-ray disc.The Dolby Atmos audio track makes this movie sound even more incredible than it looks. The surround sound pulsates straight into your bones adding an element of suspense to the intensity of the scenes.  The dialog is crisp, clean, and stands out amongst the music and ambient noise.The extras, which are located on the standard Blu-ray disc, include: The Occultist, By Reason of Demonic Possession, Exorcism of Fear and DC Horror Presents: The Conjuring: The Lover #1. Totaling all of thirty minutes, they are interesting and insightful.
As a franchise, The Conjuring movies are a cut above your average horror films but like most trilogies, they tend to get worse with each new sequel.  This time around the story isn't as interesting as its predecessors but still includes some elements that make the viewer acutely aware The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is but one part of a larger whole."
SSC_Doc7_The Conjuring 3,SSC,Horror,Negative,The Conjuring 3,"Were eight movies into the Conjuring-verse and the franchise shows no signs of abating as stalwarts Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are back as Lorraine and Ed Warren once again in The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. This latest case file sees them investigating the famous The Devil Made Me Do It case of 1981 that saw Arne Johnson murder his landlord in a rage whilst claiming he was possessed by a demon. Initial thoughts were that we could be seeing a legal horror in the vein of The Exorcism of Emily Rose but that notion is very quickly thrown aside, however, this entry is certainly stronger than most in the franchise (certainly since the original The Conjuring). The expected tropes are littered throughout, there are few surprises to be found and there are some highly questionable moments involving Lorraines clairvoyance, however, there are also some very decent sequences mixed in - a hospital religious duel and any scene with John Noble come to mind. Farmiga and Wilson are so tuned in to their characters now that their already great chemistry is sealed but maybe not enough to sell the flashbacks that this movie forces in - flashbacks that become annoyingly integral - in order to stitch together a narrative that threatens to fall apart by the slightly-ridiculous third act. Fans of the franchise will enjoy this competent slice of modern horror but its hard not to want more scares from these movies.When The Conjuring was released in 2013, we had no clue that it would open up an expansive shared universe of films. Introducing us to Ed and Lorraine Warren, the series would take us on one frightening ride after the other through various spin-offs. But as their story wraps with a third film The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, the momentum behind it is starting to feel stale.I wrote about the franchise just last year, looking at every film and struggling with the convoluted direction it had gone down. One of my biggest issues with The Devil Made Me Do It is that it didnt add anything new to the story. Other than further solidifying the relationship between Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) with some heartwarming moments, the film repeats whats been done before.From the start, were given too much. The opening sequence is long and overly informative, taking away any room for a tense build-up through the rest of the film. Its formulaic and features the same jump scares weve come to expect. The new scares are the same ones viewers would have already seen in the trailer. So you know theyre coming and the effect is ruined.The featured case in The Devil Made Me Do It is genuinely creepy, but the film doesnt rely enough on that to sell its point. Instead it tries to stuff itself with so much extra exposition. Combined with the weak horror elements, the film just doesnt close the series in a strong place."
SSC_Doc8_The Conjuring 3,SSC,Horror,Negative,The Conjuring 3,"The Devil Made Me Do It opens with a prologue and first act worthy of its predecessors. The exorcism of eight-year old David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard) pays homage to The Exorcist in several of its particulars, including the opening image of a man approaching a house. This segment of the film is eerie and effective with echoes of a powerful evil as it introduces the concept that, despite all their knowledge and experience, Ed and Lorraine arent immune. The exorcism is seemingly successful but the post-possession lull doesnt last. It soon becomes apparent that the demon has passed from David to Arne. It emerges to commit murder in a blood-drenched scene that makes use of the Blondie song Call Me..By abandoning the haunted house setting of the first two Conjuring movies  an approach that kept everything constrained and used the locale to amplify the horror  The Devil Made Me Do It spins out of control, splitting up the main characters and sending them on wild goose chases that pay minimal dividends. The ultimate villain is disappointing and the final confrontation is anticlimactic. Putting aside the prologue exorcism, theres little in the movie that could be considered frightening.  (Although, if you have a pathological fear of rats, there is one scene with Lorraine on her hands and knees in a crawl space that may require a few moments diverted attention.). One of the unsung pleasures of The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2  an element not found in any of the spin-offs  is the chemistry between actors Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. The affection and companionship of Ed and Lorraine comes across in the performances and, in addition to exhibiting a genuine emotional bond, the characters radiate competence. If I was going through a possession, Id want them on the case. The Devil Made Me Do It relies less on the connection between Wilson and Farmiga than on cheesy flashbacks (with younger actors  Mitchell Hoog and Megan Ashley Brown  playing the roles) to emphasize the depth of Ed and Lorraines love for one another. Its a clumsy misstep. Although both Wilson and Farmiga have returned to the series, there are significant behind-the-camera changes and these may have had something to do with the drop-off in quality. James Wan, the director of The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2, stepped down in favor of his hand-picked successor, Michael Chaves (who made the 2019 spin-off, The Curse of La Llorona). While Chaves shows ability in developing a sinister tone, he is less sure when it comes to maintaining a white knuckle, edge-of-the-seat sensibility. Writers Chad Hayes & Carey W. Hayes have also moved on. One cant help but wonder whether these substitutions are a key component in moving The Devil Made Me Do It away from the high level of its forerunners and more into the realm of generic 21st century horror. Whatever the cause may be, the magic previously enjoyed by The Conjuring movies has failed to materialize for this journey into the supernatural."
SSC_Doc9_The Conjuring 3,SSC,Horror,Negative,The Conjuring 3,"Out of all my mothers wisdom, two ideas about evil from my childhood endure: MLMs are immoral scams, and demons are not to be trifled with. Though the R-rated The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It would likely have been as forbidden from our Evangelical home as Amway products, my mom wouldve agreed with its basic premise of the presence of demonic forces. The third Conjuring film feels like a throwback to the Satanic Panic era I grew up in, not only in its 1980s setting, but also in its associations between earthly evil and hellish beings intent on murder and mayhem for no discernible reason. Audiences might not buy the films holy water-steeped philosophy or find its scares as strong as those in The Conjuring (2013) or The Conjuring 2 (2016), but theyll still emerge with sufficient chills  and plenty of time spent with horrors cutest couple.The latest horror movie in the blockbuster Conjuring universe acts as penance for the series recent sins. The spinoff Annabelle Comes Home (2019) only featured a few scenes with the husband and wife who are the soul of the series: Ed and Lorraine Warren, played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. Here Ed and Lorraine are the focus for the films entirety, as it spends its two-hour runtime on a single story, based on a real-life case.In 1981, the Warrens participated in the exorcism of eight-year-old David Glatzel (the adorable, bespectacled Julian Hilliard of The Haunting of Hill House). While their efforts initially appear successful  other than giving Ed a literal heart attack  they soon realize that the demon that possessed the boy isnt gone; it moved into the nearby body of Davids sisters boyfriend, Arne Johnson (Ruairi OConnor). Shortly after, the formerly sweet Arne commits murder, shocking both his devoted girlfriend, Debbie (Sarah Catherine Hook), and his entire small town. The Warrens are drawn back into the dark situation, as they help Arne to plead not guilty by reason of demonic possession in his trial for murder.For a brief moment, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It looks as though it will morph into a true crime/horror hybrid, radically evolving its formula after so many previous films. However, writer David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and director Michael Chaves veer left, skimming over the legal proceedings and sticking with the devil they know. But they dont quite do whats expected either; Ed and Lorraine are somehow even more central  and even more in peril  than theyve been in earlier adventures, as they become the specific targets of the films villain. Their enviable relationship (you know, other than always being surrounded by demons) has always brought real substance and emotion to the franchise, as well as the sense of how truly good these people are amidst all the evil they deal with. The audience actually cares about them, a rarity in the genre, thanks to years of character building and always solid performances from Wilson and Farmiga. 
That emotional investment is what makes the goofy third act in this movie such a letdown. Chaves previously directed the stealth franchise entry  and dud  The Curse of la Llorona in 2019, but he knows how to make the audience squirm with some icky sequences (my fear of crawlspaces has been validated) and unsettling visuals. However, once we arrive at the final scenes, theres little that truly terrifies  which is what I come to these films for, other than vintage tie-neck blouses and marriage inspiration. The climax gets a little silly, evoking more eye rolls than gasps. Meanwhile, Arnes plight feels more like an afterthought than what is theoretically driving the story forward. By its very nature, the evil at the heart of this movie should feel scarier than either The Conjurings Annabelle doll or The Conjuring 2s demon nun Valak, but it never reaches the levels of primal fear its forerunners did. 
Quality-wise, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It resides squarely in the middle of this eight-film universe, creeping past the spin-offs and sneaking up on the pair of movies at the center of the series. With its third-act stumbles, it never quite catches either The Conjuring or The Conjuring 2, but it proves there is still spirit left in this franchise. James Wan set the bar high, and even a film that misses those heights is still among the better studio horror offerings thanks to the grounding presence of Wilson and Farmiga and their beloved characters"
SSC_Doc10_The Conjuring 3,SSC,Horror,Negative,The Conjuring 3,"Money is no issue for The Conjuring films. The series is one of the biggest, most convoluted studio IPs that doesnt derive from comic books, and the core films of James Wans demonic Catholic cinematic universe are some of the most expensive looking horror films being made today. Theyre wonderfully period accurate with beautiful touches, incredible camera rigging, and detailed costuming. Extravagant set pieces be damned, though  including a well-executed scene involving a luxurious waterbed  The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It doesnt live up to the bone-chilling focus, simplicity, and direction of Wans first film in this bloated eight-part series.The Devil Made Me Do It director Michael Chaves replicates Wans flair the best he can, with sweeping wide shots of gorgeous houses and quiet, misleading spooky sequences that erect into clutch-your-pearls jump scares. Theres even a visual callback to the first films signature scare, an attempt to recreate the tension of Lili Taylors infamous basement clap game by stuffing Vera Farmiga, who plays medium Lorraine Warren, in a tiny crawlspace under the obligatory cursed family home. Chaves is a smooth copycat, much better at recreating Wans vision than the Annabelle and Nun spinoffs that swirl around the main series, to a point where its debatable as to how much of the directorial reigns Chaves held, and if The Devil Made Me Do It was even half as good as its genre neighbor, Poltergeist, this could be a film where people debated the truth behind the director credit for decades.But to buy into The Devil Made Me Do It, Chaves, Wan, and co-writer David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick ask you to buy into the innocence of a small-town upstanding gentleman, Arne (OConnor), who couldnt have possibly murdered the boss and landlord of his girlfriend, Debbie Glatzel (Hook). The series being based on the case files of the real-life Warrens, two notorious con artists who profited off desperate people, was never much of a distraction until this particular entry.The Devil Made Me Do It showcases Ed Warren (Wilson) and wife Lorraine hopping around the judicial system, proving the existence of demons, and defeating skepticism in ways that Dana Scully and Fox Mulder could never. Set in the thick of the Satanic Panic, the Warrens sincere case of Arnes innocence is disturbing, negligent, and even dangerous. The Devil Made Me Do It twists reality (in truth, the demon defense was not accepted in court), and plays it up as fact, something thats not often an issue but in an age where conspiracy is increasingly running amok, this entry feels a bit more misguided.The Devil Made Me Do Its mystery is weighed down in explosive set pieces and grander acts of devotion, both religious and martial, which loses the focus of the (albeit dull) setup. An overlong climax that channels both The Exorcist and The Shining is tired by tropes, snapping back and forth between Arnes battle against the evil forces that still possess him in jail and the Warrens' even grander battle against the Big Bad Occult-Obsessed Witch who is the baddie pulling the strings. Theres an explicit theme of love conquers all, as seen in both Debbie and Arnes loyalty and the Warrens ongoing blistering passion. Its a thread that clicks more in the preceding films, and one that is exhausted in this entry.Its disappointing to stop rooting for a blockbuster behemoth horror series, but The Conjuring movies quality and talon-tight hold has rapidly deflated over time. The films have lost sight of what made them grand, escapist, and celebrated, and burning the based on true events marquee to evoke sympathy in this particular case is disengaging"
AMN_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCarribeanTheCurseoftheBlackPearl,AMN,Action,Positive,Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"While Depp has had numerous memorable roles, Captain Sparrow is by far the most intriguing of his characters and displays his talent as an actor.  Bloom and Knightly, both young in the first of the film series, show potential and play their roles well.  Seasoned actors Price and Rush, round out this talented cast and the combination of all of them together is a well-put-together ensemble.

This is the first time the film has been released in 4K and fans won't be disappointed.  The 2160p HD resolution is the cleanest version of the video presentation to date.  With a clean transfer offering enhanced details and hues, one can immediately tell there is a marked difference in sharpness from previously released version of the film.

The Dolby Atmos audio track is also an upgrade, and the quality is obvious when compared to previously released discs.  However, the audio isn't overwhelmingly incredible when compared to other properties' upgraded audio tracks.  It has some decent reverberation but lacks some of the depth audiences have come to expect from this type of enhancement.  The low tones are decent but don't test the limits of the subwoofer speaker.

The Combo pack includes a previously released Blu-ray copy, a digital download, and the 4K disc.  The extras are the biggest disappointment as they are all previously released and only includes half of the extras released on the two Blu-ray set from 2011.  If you were hoping to replace your 2011 Blu-ray set, I wouldn't just yet as this new release doesn't offer as much in terms of extras.

Pirates of the Caribbean has become an incredibly successful franchise and deservedly so but, while this 4K release offers some upgrades, it falls short of being a combo pack one needs to rush right out to buy.

If you are a fan of the series, and you have some extra money gifted to you during the holidays, this set may be one you would want to consider."
AMN_Doc2_PiratesOfTheCarribeanTheCurseoftheBlackPearl,AMN,Action,Positive,Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"The curse of the Black Pearl turns out to be real, based on the thieving of Cortez Aztec gold, in turn founded dually by history and myth. This allows for impressive computer-animated, zombie-like creatures to make an appearance (crafted by Industrial Light & Magic). Nearly all the elements of the story are knowledgeably adapted from famous pirate legends and customs (the film doesnt miss the chance to have a plank-walking scene), as well as the amusing Disneyland ride itself. Many of the scenes are reminiscent of the tourist attraction, treating the characters as if theyre on the ride (such as when Elizabeth is tossed about as if on a trampoline by her pirate captors), and several of the battle sequences correspondingly mirror events structured by the original animatronic participants. Several other shots duplicate sets from the theme park almost exactly.

Locations are painstakingly reconstructed, costumes are elaborate and authentic, props like the massive ships are beautifully detailed, and the stunt choreography and related fight sequences (including characters sword fighting in the rafters after having been catapulted there by a makeshift seesaw, a cannon attack on Port Royal, and the climactic side-by-side showdown between the Black Pearl and the HMS Interceptor) are thrilling beyond what is generally witnessed in a Disney live-action film. This is largely thanks to director Gore Verbinski, having previously worked on the darker thematic material of The Ring. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is altogether breathtaking in its scope; its mindboggling to think that the humble origins of a theme park attraction could not only lead to such an expansive thematic universe, but also to such immense moneymaking possibilities.

Despite a few cheesy one-liners, the screenplay is surprisingly keen (most of the dialogue is a mix of familiar pirate lingo, archaic phrases, and sharp sarcasm). The comedy elements work nicely with the characters, which are shaped to be equal portions serious and funny, but always manageably believable within the realm of this visually splendid world of magic and adventure. Utilizing the verbiage and the humor is an abundance of entertaining character actors, including Jonathan Pryce, Kevin McNally, Zoe Saldana, and Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook as the featherbrained pirate duo Pintel and Ragetti. But its Johnny Depp who steals the show, creating a swashbuckling persona so outrageously regaling it would single-handedly guarantee sequels. His performance was also notably and unexpectedly nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award. And last but not least, the thundering, unforgettable score by Klaus Badelt is all but synonymous with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise."
AMN_Doc3_PiratesOfTheCarribeanTheCurseoftheBlackPearl,AMN,Action,Positive,Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"If there was a minor quibble with the movie, it is that it is a little overlong. Putting that aside, this is a truly wonderful film, that is definitely one of the highlights of 2003. The whole film is a wonder to look at, with splendid costumes and very realistic sets. The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like ""Stop blowing holes in my ship,"" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox."
AMN_Doc4_PiratesOfTheCarribeanTheCurseoftheBlackPearl,AMN,Action,Positive,Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"I know I'm late to rate this. This is my favorite movie franchise of all time (minus the 4th and 5th). Although it doesn't tell a heart warming/sob story, it takes you out of your real life and into a fantastical realm where anything is possible. Magic, witches, pirates, curses. This movie is what got me into cinema and acting. Kiera Knightley is just the most profound actress of all time. She is so insanely underrated in my opinion. The range. The emotion. I'm such a damsel in distress lover and she just made me so happy when watching this. Orlando Bloom, as well. The chemistry the two shared was unmatched. Johnny Depp. I cannot get enough of this man and his acting. Talk about robbed of an Oscar. The only Jack Sparrow in my eyes. The essence. The choices. The acting. Stellar. Remarkable. I've seen this movie 25 times and counting. It never gets old."
AMN_Doc5_PiratesOfTheCarribeanTheCurseoftheBlackPearl,AMN,Action,Positive,Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"Shiver me timbers. After the disastrous Haunted Mansion (2003), Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl should have not worked. In 2003, no one was exactly anticipating Disney's live-action adaptation of one of their oldest and cheesiest theme park attractions. However, Gore Verbinski (The Cure For Wellness) directs with such energy and creativity that the story is exhilarating. It's a scary tale about ghost pirates, romance and rum, plenty of rum. The set pieces are well-conceived and feel alive with a palpable sense of history. Johnny Depp's (Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas) iconic creation of Jack Sparrow carries the picture. The way he walks and the way he talks, he just inhibits the character perfectly. Opposite him is the incredible Geoffrey Rush (The King's Speech). Playing the perfect antagonist, the pair riff of each other brilliantly. The Curse Of The Black Pearl remains a rarity that not only met my expectations but exceeded them. I can clearly recall after leaving the cinema in the summer of 2003 eager to see it again."
AMN_Doc6_PiratesOfTheCarribeanTheCurseoftheBlackPearl,AMN,Action,Negative,Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"If you think the title is long, wait until you see the movie.  At two hours, 23 minutes running time, a good guy captured by pirates should pray for a plank to walk thats this long.  Gone with the Wind, which covered the Civil War and its aftermath, was only 55 minutes longer. Although you might find it hard to believe as youre sitting through it, it does end eventually, and the proof is that I am actually sitting here writing this review.

Johnny Depp plays a constantly inebriated pirate captain (Jack Sparrow) in this tongue-in-cheek sendup of pirate movies.  Did we really need a sendup of pirate movies?  Whens the last time you saw one?  Who was in it?  Burt Lancaster?  Gene Kelly?  Errol Flynn?  What, Hollywood has nothing better to do than spoof a genre thats been dead for fifty years?

 And, please, if youre going to do a spoof, make it intelligent.  People it with good actors.  Give it a good script.  Give it a story, for heavens sake.  Alas, Disney/Jerry Bruckheimer did none of these.  Oh, there are a couple of guys, Geoffrey Rush, who plays the dastardly Captain Barbossa, and another guy, who do pale imitations of Robert Newton as Long John Silver in Treasure Island, circa 1950, the quintessential cinematic pirate.  But, like this movie, they fall way, way short of Newtons genius. 

 In the unlikely event that you still want to see this, I wont ruin it for you by telling the story (thats a joke, son).  Theres Hitchcocks mainstay, the McGuffin that the pirates need, and its all pretty silly, but thats OK because this is a farce (and I dont use that as a term of opprobrium; its meant to be a farce). But I will warn you that, except for Depp and Rush, the actings mediocre at best.  Keira Knightly, who did a workmanlike job in Bend it Like Beckham is mightily miscast here as the gorgeous damsel in distress, Elizabeth Swann.  Shes not gorgeous enough (shes not gorgeous, period).  And the lines shes given would put any actress to the test.  Depps besotted Captain Sparrow starts out humorous, but finally becomes tiresome.  Im also offended by vacuous filmmakers who think its funny to show the harmless drunk.  Alcoholism is no joke, folks, and movies like this (and the worst of the loveable drunk genre, Arthur) trivialize a serious problem.  Hollywood, however, loves drugs; youre not gonna breathe much if you hold your breath until Hollywood takes a stand against drug use.  Even though we dont see him taking a drink until near the longed-for end, Sparrows constantly drunk, even when hes locked away in jail.

 This has a lot of mindless violence.  But thats what you would expect in a pirate movie, unless its The Pirates of Penzance. Here people keep fighting dead people who cant be killed.  They knew they were dead going in.  Whats the point?  And the fights take up about the last seven hours (OK, it just seemed like seven hours) of the movie.  One fight after another between a man and a skeleton.  Then theres a fight between two skeletons.  There apparently arent any Basil Rathbones left in Hollywood because all the sword fighting is shot with Chicago-like quick cuts so you cant see if any of these hunks can actually handle a sword.

 This is apparently a big hit if you judge by numbers.  The only way I can explain this is to postulate that watching this after sitting through Charlies Angels: Full Throttle, Legally Blonde 2, and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is akin to the relief you feel when someone stops hitting you over the head with a hammer and starts pinching you.  Its good only in comparison with what came before."
AMN_Doc7_PiratesOfTheCarribeanTheCurseoftheBlackPearl,AMN,Action,Negative,Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"Fans of the swashbuckling epics will be happy to know that Pirates of the Caribbean evokes memories of the dying genre. And while the film has plenty of action that works, it eventually succumbs to overkill in a heavily padded, 2:15 running time.The film centers around a cursed gold medallion that initially comes in contact with a young pirate Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). When Turner, who doesnt know hes a pirate, is rescued by a British fleet led by Gov. Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), the medallion is taken by Swanns daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), to conceal Turners true identity from her father, keeping Turner safe. Eight years later, the crew of the ship, the Black Pearl, led by Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), comes after the medallion, which holds the key to breaking the crews cursed existence.Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth and Turner enlists the aid of a rogue pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to rescue the young maiden.From the moment Depp appears on camera, theres a certain charm in the actors swagger. Depp plays Sparrow like a cross between Val Kilmer in The Doors and Dudley Moore in Arthur, and watching his performance is a lot of fun.Bloom makes for a good young hero, while Knightley is a major find as the young heroine. Even Rush appears to be having a lot of fun as the evil Barbossa.Director Gore Verbinski stages some visually spectacular action sequences, while Ted Elliott and Terry Rossios screenplay clearly doesnt take itself too seriously.Unfortunately, all of the films good will is eventually washed away in a mammoth running time that definitely bogs down the fun. The film could have easily wrapped up in 90 minutes, yet it stumbles on with several action sequences that are essentially repeats of earlier scenes. Theres always too much going on, which is easily forgivable for a while. But as the minutes mount, the flaws are only accentuated. Like his previous film, the superior The Ring, Verbinski just doesnt seem to understand when enough is enough.Pirates of the Caribbean holds the distinction as being the first film to be released with a PG-13 rating under the Walt Disney Picture label. That distinction will probably be the only thing that this near miss will be remembered for. In an already-crowded summer action field, Pirates proves to be its own worst enemy. "

AMN_Doc9_PiratesOfTheCarribeanTheCurseoftheBlackPearl,AMN,Action,Negative,Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl in My opinion is not one of the greatest movies of all time. Sure, it has a huge budget, a different cast (which included Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Jonathan Pryce!), great special effects, and a lengthy two hour plus run time but this film never did anything for Me and here are the reasons why it didn't.

The following is in My opinion.

1. Johnny Depp is a good actor but I just didn't know what to think of his character whether I should like him, hate him, or feel sorry for him.

2. I'm an action movie nut and there was a lot of action but the action just wasn't exciting enough that its so great it'll be one of the films I'll see over and over. In other words nothing special or spectacular happened in this one.

3. The music by up coming composer Klaus Badelt was ok but most of it was just recycled of Hans Zimmer's one of a kind score from the greatest epic called Gladiator (2000)! Badelt composed an excellent score for the Time Machine and retooled the music and this is what we get for this? Why?

4. Some of the things that happened in the film was supposed to be funny but I didn't think it was and I didn't think the comedy stuff was needed.

5. The late great Trevor Goddard had a brief role in this movie and I believe it was his last one. Why give an actor with an incredible muscular build, a unique accent, and amazing talent a scene where it makes him look like a complete joke?

You may be thinking why I am saying this. How can I say this about a movie that is so high in fame and stature? I am just saying how I feel about the film. The film had all the potential and everything going for it but it just didn't do it. I wanted to like the movie but it never changed. I don't agree about it being on the IMDb's Top 250: #235! In fact, I think it shouldn't even be on the list. There are many other films that deserve to be on the list more than this film! You mean to tell Me that this is on the same list with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy? Plus there are many more movies with much more excitement similar to this movie like the Planet of the Apes (2001), The Mummy, and The Mummy Returns, and Cutthroat Island! In My opinion Pirates of the Caribbean's competion The Hulk and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was so much better and exciting in My opinion! Anyway I feel if you wanted to watch a much more epic pirate movie instead see Cutthroat Island, its much more exciting! I hate to say this but Pirates of the Caribbean is awfully dull, boring, uninteresting, uninspiring, it has no depth, and it should be avoided like a flood!"
AMN_Doc10_PiratesOfTheCarribeanTheCurseoftheBlackPearl,AMN,Action,Negative,Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"I expected more and I am disappointed. I mean there could have been more suspense elements cause sometimes it was boring and too long. They could cut at least 30 minutes. I have to admit that the special effects and the picture were great. It is not a must see and I would recommend it to teenies. I won`t see the sequel. Watch instead ""The Ring"" from the same director which I really enjoyed. My wife and I vote not more than 5/10. Just average. On IMDb too overrated. I still cannot believe that this made over 300 Mio. US$ at the box office. I hope Hollywood will create more precious pearls than this black pearl."
ARW_Doc1_MissionImpossibleFallout,Akshit Raja,Action,Positive,Mission Impossible Fallout,"Since the beginning, the Mission: Impossible movies have always been a showcase for Tom Cruise doing insane stunts for our amusement. And god bless the crazy little Scientology monster for that. Ive said many times that if he can dieand Im not sure he canhes going to die doing one of these movies, and I find a certain nobility in people putting themselves in harms way to entertain me. The last few chapters, however, has been a constant escalation in this regard as the franchise frontman pushes further and further the bounds of sanity and insurance coverage with each successive stunt. And Mission: ImpossibleFallout takes things to a whole new stratosphere. Literally in one case.


We all remember him dangling off a plane and holding his breath for six minutes last time out in Mission: ImpossibleRogue Nation. Thats all well and good, but its kind of kid stuff compared to what he did for Fallout. Not only does he do most of his own stunts when it comes to zipping around European cities at breakneck speed on a motorcycle, handle the bulk of the fighting, and snap his own ankle leaping from roof to roof. Thats not enough. He learned to fly a helicopter for a major action centerpiece just so we can see its obviously him by himself during the shots. As if that doesnt obliterate the limits, he also jumped out of a plane 106 times to film a HALOhigh altitude, low openingsequence. This includes multiple actual HALO jumps, which means he jumped out of a perfectly good airplane at more than 25,000 feet with an oxygen mask and reached speeds of more than 200 mph. Multiple times. Just to make us gawk. And it works.

I dont mean to go on and on about Tom Cruisethough I do maintain hes the last true movie star we have leftbut all of this accomplishes something important for the film. It gives the action in Fallout, and the other Mission: Impossible movies, an edge, a sense of actual danger. We watch him actually do these things. Though we know, rationally, hes as safe as possible, its still him doing all these insane things. When he barrels through Paris, thats him. Same when he dangles off a building or cliff. It sells the action and gives it a visceral quality that so many action movies lack. Even when the film employs digital effects, they use state-of-the-art technology that blends seamlessly with the practical work. Ive seen Fallout compared to Mad Max: Fury Road, and while the action never quite hits those ludicrous highsI still have no clue how everyone didnt die filming thatits as close as anything has come, or probably will, for a long time.

As usual, and as it should be, the plot serves as a delivery system for the action. The Impossible Mission Force of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) is back at it, trying to recover stolen plutonium from a self-stylized global apocalyptic terrorist death cult called The Apostles. Tagging along, they have CIA agent/wet-work specialist August Walker (Henry Cavill), former ally/love interest Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) pops up, and they once again tussle with international baddie Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who has an axe to grind with this particular crew of espionage professionals.

Though it often nears jumbled territory, to the brink of coherence, and it relies too heavily on preexisting franchise knowledge and character work, the narrative does what it needs to do. If youre familiar with these movies at all, its easy to spot whats coming. The betrayals happen in all the expected places, as do the things-are-not-what-they-seem moments, the face-peelings, the layer on top of layer of misdirection. Still, writer/director Christopher McQuarries script manages to keep things engaging and tense and tricky between action spectacles, and though its tangled, it never bogs down. The story-telling fireworks never cause the pace to flag and you rarely feel the 147-minute run time.

Mission: ImpossibleFallout has everything fans want. The action is top notch and a constant amplification of what came before, like every scene resulted from McQuarrie daring Cruise to take things one step further. Though they dont bring anything new to the table, the characters are engaging and theres enough of an emotional connection its not simply a pyrotechnic action spectacular. Fallout is brisk and propulsive and blockbuster summertime popcorn entertainment at its peak. And Tom Cruise didnt die filming it, at least not that weve been told, so that means well probably get another one, which is good news. "
ARW_Doc2_MissionImpossibleFallout,Akshit Raja,Action,Positive,Mission Impossible Fallout,"Throughout this latest adventure, we hear super agent Ethan Hunt utter the phrase, I wont let you down. While that plays as a crucial element in the plot, we can also examine it from the actor who delivers the line. Tom Cruise, at fifty six years young, seems to be talking directly at us  the audience  letting us know that he will give us exactly what were looking for: high octane action and death defying stunts. Cruise is one of the last movie stars of his kind, combining his immense screen presence with a keen understanding of how to entertain. He is the ultimate showman, able to adapt to changing times. Although he has had his fair share of duds, he never goes into a project without full commitment. Think about this: the Mission: Impossible series has gone on for over twenty years and is only getting better. Where many action stars fade the older they get, Cruise rushes forward, pushing the limit (both physically and mentally) for our enjoyment.

But Fallout isnt just the Tom Cruise Show. Here now is the emergence of Christopher McQuarrie as an elite action director. The previous entry, Mission: Impossible  Rogue Nation (2015) was great fun and had plenty of intrigue, but Fallout tops it with its set pieces, intricate plotting, and breathless pacing. The balance between practical effects and CGI is perfectly handled. To a larger degree is an emotional factor that catches us off guard. We get all the thrills that we expect and yet McQuarrie (who also wrote screenplay) sneaks in a character study that makes the material all the richer. The cinematography (Rob Hardy) is assured and confident. We see everything clearly, the framing allowing us to witness Cruise in full view of his numerous stunt work. Eddie Hamiltons editing cuts between shots with clarity. At no point is there confusion in the geography of a set piece. Lorne Balfes score is pulse pounding, calling to mind the feel of a crime thriller.

Breaking the episodic nature of the series, Fallout acts as a direct sequel to Rogue Nation. This time we see Ethan dealing with the moral dilemma of being an agent  whether or not its better to sacrifice one life if it means saving millions more. That idea has always existed in the background of the previous entries, but here is where it comes to full fruition. Ethan is a man who cannot fathom making the hard choice; he would rather sacrifice himself than see a single person perish. Its that weakness that causes Ethan and his partners Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) to lose a case of plutonium into the hands of bad guys, putting many lives at risk.

But that weakness is also Ethans greatest strength, motivating him to track down the plutonium with unrelenting obsession. Why does Ethan feel the need to go out on a limb even when the goal appears unreachable? The answer is the same with many other movie heroes: because he has to. Ethan saves lives because he must, and he does it like no one else. Along for the ride is CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) assigned to keep a watchful eye over Ethan and his team. Theres also the reappearance of the mysterious British agent Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), and Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) the villain of Rogue Nation who has returned with destruction and chaos on his mind.

After an early expository scene, McQuarrie puts his foot on the gas and never lets up. Fallout constantly moves, even the quieter, character driven moments are designed with urgency. Ethan tackles his mission like a mad man, and Cruise tackles his role in the same vein. Cruise performs a HALO jump, goes on high speed chases in a truck, in a car, and on a motorcycle through the streets of Paris, engages in a brutal hand to hand fight inside of a nightclub bathroom  and this is all happens before he famously broke his ankle jumping from one rooftop to another (the shot is used in the movie).

All throughout, McQuarrie makes the precise right decisions on how to depict the action. The bathroom fight scene is done with no music, allowing us to hear and feel every punch. The motorcycle chase is shot from three angles (in front of the bike, to the side, and from behind), ensuring that we can see Cruise is the one driving it, narrowly missing being smacked by a passing car. During a rescue operation, a character is stuck inside of a truck slowly submerging into the Seine river. The camera inside captures the rising water sideways like a growing wall coming to take its victim. McQuarries biggest improvement as a director is by building the tension all the way up to the climax. In Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol (2011) the key set piece always happened right in the middle of the plot, causing the third act to sink just a bit. That is not the case with Fallout, in which the final showdown is a spectacular feat of imagination, execution, and fearlessness. I dare not describe it to you and spoil the fun.

Not enough can be said about Cruises fantastic performance. Not only in the physical sense (at one point he runs so hard that it looks like hes about to take off) but also as a dynamic, fully developed character. To Ethan, every life matters. Occasionally, McQuarrie will bring the narrative to a standstill and focus in on Cruises face during a moment of emotional conflict, where he is faced with a decision he simply does not want to make. Every instance of this is effective, causing us to understand that Ethan is not a machine, but a flesh a blood person whose acts of violence against others leave a lasting effect.

Mission: Impossible  Fallout is the kind of movie that causes people to fall in love with movies. The craftsmanship is stellar, the performances are great, the action awe-inspiring, and the story deeply involving. Being a film fan means being in a constant search for an experience that puts us on the edge of our seats and grab the armrests with excitement. This delivers that in spades. As Cruise says, I wont let you down  and he certainly didnt."
ARW_Doc3_MissionImpossibleFallout,Akshit Raja,Action,Positive,Mission Impossible Fallout,"I would give 4  STARS. AN ELEPHANTINE ACTION EPIC. Writing a review for Mission Impossible  Fallout gave my thesaurus a workout. The film, the sixth instalment in the Tom Cruise franchise, is jammed to the gills with next-level stunts that require an expanded vocabulary to describe. Words like extreme or exciting or even epic (and those are only the e words) dont come close to describing the behemothic action sequences contained within.

Cruise returns as the seemingly invincible action man and IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan Hunt. Hunt and his crew, tech wiz Benji (Simon Pegg) and agent Luther (Ving Rhames), are charged with finding and capturing anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), a baddie who was the leader of the Syndicate during the last film, Rogue Nation. Whatever you heard about Lane, explains Hunt, if it makes your skin crawl its probably true. Lane is working with the mysterious and murderous John Lark, a man with some extreme ideas about squashing the world order.

As Lark and Lane collect the necessary plutonium to fulfil their plan the CIA begins to have doubts about Hunts loyalty. Add to that the return of former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), and some newbies, CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) and black market arms dealer and lady of mystery White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) and you have lots of characters to fill the space between the stunts. Complicating matters is the fallout from some of Hunts previous, well-intentioned missions.

There are a lot of very good-looking people in Mission Impossible  Fallout. Handsome fellas and femme fatales, they are all woven into a stylish story of international intrigue and plutonium. Like the others MI movies its packed with exotic locationsonly James Bond has more air travel points than Ethan Huntdoublespeak and double crosses but the narrative doesnt matter that much, its all in service of the Bunyanesque action.

Choreographed to an inch of Hunts lifeCruise really puts himself out there for this onethe realism of the stunts gives the movie a sense of danger and the Green Screen Department the day off. Monumental, vertigo inducing single sequences take place on land, wheels, water and air. Only the screeching of tires score one eye-peeling chase scene between a motorcycle and a car. Visually it is so visceral director Christopher McQuarrie wisely avoided cluttering the scene with frenetic music. It doesnt need it.

Of course those looking for a finely crafted John le Carr style story of espionage in Mission Impossible  Fallout will be bitterly disappointed. While it does contain huggerymuggery it frequently falls just this side of making sense. Thats not to say it isnt entertaining. Even when Hunt isnt in action the movie is in perpetual motion, but Frederick Forsyth this aint. Instead it is an elephantine (although no actual elephants appear) action epic that breaks the blockbuster norm of cutting away to an action sequence every ten minutes or so. Its made up of three Brobdingnagian set pieces stitched together by words that mostly make sense."
ARW_Doc4_MissionImpossibleFallout,Akshit Raja,Action,Positive,Mission Impossible Fallout,"Tom Cruise is the cinemas greatest action star. Fortunately, such a hyperbolic claim is not without an argument to back it up. Around the dawn of the last century, Douglas Fairbanks swashbuckled his way to fame by climbing walls, riding horses, and swinging from ropes in titles like The Mark of Zorro (1920) or Robin Hood (1922). Although Fairbanks was an accomplished gymnast, he eventually conceded to use stunt doubles for the most daring feats. After Fairbanks, Errol Flynn took the crown, having shot his own arrows and performed dangerous sword fights in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) and The Sea Hawk (1940). In the subsequent decades, actors including Tyrone Power, Bruce Lee, Harrison Ford, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and others became action icons, but few could actually perform the exploits of their characters and instead relied on the talents of stunt workers. Perhaps because their skills are evident onscreen, martial artists have dominated cinematic bravado in recent decades, allowing for Jackie Chan and Jason Statham to impress with their ability to carry out elaborately choreographed fights. But how many of these actors, from Fairbanks to Chan, have tied themselves to the side of a plane? How many have driven at top speeds in fast-paced motorcycle races, hung from a helicopter midair, climbed mountains without a net, outran an exploding aquarium, or held his breath underwater for several minutes? How many have dangled on the tallest building in the world?

Only Cruise has subjected himself to such exploits and more for the sake of screen action, and the above-listed examples remain restricted to the Mission: Impossible franchise, still going strong since its dazzling Brian De Palma debut in 1996. The sixth entry, Mission: Impossible  Fallout, contains some series-best spectacles, among them a memorable car chase to rival the one in The French Connection (1971), brutal hand-to-hand combat, and a breathless helicopter chasefor which Cruise learned to fly helicopters and then piloted his own craft in the film. Director Christopher McQuarrie, who captained the previous entry, Rogue Nation, sells every incredible set-piece not just because he realizes the proceedings in such a clearly presented way, complete with an effortless shot-by-shot logic and visual cohesion, but because Cruise sells the most unbelievable moments in the film by actually performing them. Theres almost no reliance on stage pieces or CGI, allowing, subconsciously, the viewer to recognize, somewhere in the back of our minds, that what were seeing onscreen is realas opposed to the usual Hollywood confection. Cruise and McQuarrie engross the viewer by making the most outlandish stunts look and feel like they really happened.

More than the first two titles in the Mission: Impossible franchise, the last few have maintained a relatively steady character base and plot after J.J. Abrams reinvigorated the material in 2006. But Fallout follows closely the events and characters from Rogue Nation, and even maintains the same villain and supporting players. IMF point man Ethan Hunt, backed by his behind-the-scenes tech support Luther (Ving Rhames) and his other techie-turned-field-man Benji (Simon Pegg), operates under the close watch of their new department head, Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). Hunts team has been tasked with taking down The Apostles, a terrorist faction devoted to the notion that the greater the suffering, the greater the peacehence their resolution to cause as much suffering across the globe as possible. The Apostles follow in the footsteps of their former leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who was imprisoned by Hunt and Co. at the end of the last film. One of Lanes devotees named John Lark, presumably a double-agent in U.S. intelligence, hopes to acquire three plutonium cores in an effort to create three nuclear weapons. Hunts team accepts the impossible mission to identify Lark, recover the cores, and stop Lanes Apostles once and for all.

At the same time, the CIAs Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) demands one of her agents, the towering brute August Walker (Henry Cavill), oversee Hunts progress. She calls Walker the hammer to Hunts scalpel, and more than once Walkers unsubtle approach turns the IMFs carefully laid plans to bare. Returning to the mix is Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), a former MI6 agent who walked away from her life of undercover spying in Lanes Syndicate. Which is to say, its helpful if Fallouts audience remembers the events in Rogue Nation, even Mission: Impossible III, to appreciate in full the emotional significance of the events here. To be sure, Hunts estranged wife, played by Michelle Monaghan, makes several appearances in the film, lending to Hunts characterization as a man driven by a terrifying fear that, should Lane and his cohorts succeed, hell be unable to save the people who matter most to him. For Sloan, Hunts willingness to sacrifice the success of an entire mission, in which millions of lives hang in the balance, in exchange for a single life, means the agent has been compromised.

The script, written by McQuarrie, rewards those who pay close attention to the plot machinations and twists throughout, without dwelling on moments or dumbing them down for an inattentive audience. About mid-film, an unassuming sequence that takes place in a series of underground tunnels contains about three twists and double-crosses in a matter of minutes, each more effective and unpredictable than the last, and McQuarrie allows them to unfold thoughtfully, trusting his audience to keep up. Not that it requires much to follow the story, as McQuarrie efficiently sketches out the stakes early in the films breezes-by, two-and-a-half-hour runtime. The structure, modeled after the Hitchcockian ideal of grabbing the viewer from the first sequence and not letting go, never allows the viewer a moment of ease. Alfred Hitchcock has long been an influence on the franchise, from the elegantly conceived set-pieces, to the wrong-man-thriller elements, to the way each film forces the viewer to hold their breath until the last possible moment. Throughout the remainder, the audience follows along, either invested in the weighty dramatic arcs for characters like Hunt, Ilsa, and Benji, or attuned to the remarkable action. Most viewers will walk away from Fallout exhilarated, talking about Cruises stunts or the downright exhausting chases (by motorcycle, automobile, helicopter, and foot), but the story rewards those invested in the characters. And while McQuarries script contains less humor or moments of levity than the previous two sequels, the lofty threat of nuclear genocide and personal loss intensify the stakes more than previous missions.

McQuarrie began his string of collaborations with Tom Cruise as the screenwriter of Valkyrie (2008); he later directed the actor on Jack Reacher (2012), and also contributed to the deft scripting on Edge of Tomorrow (2014). Even with McQuarries accomplished filmmaking on Rogue Nation, his work on Fallout is a leap in craft and skill. Hes elevated himself from a screenwriter-turned-director to an extraordinarily accomplished visualist with a fully realized aesthetic. Shot by Rob Hardy (Annihilation), theres a soft, Nolan-esque sheen to the proceedings, recalling the look of Inception or The Dark Knight. Hardys rather straightforward, plainly presented lensing of the action, along with Eddie Hamiltons editing, capture the daring and death-defying stunts in all their considerable glory. The production seems engineered to make the most of Cruises devotion to action realism, particularly in the last 20 minutes when Hunt inches up a payload rope attached to the bottom of a helicopter, guides himself inside to the front of the craft, and then takes over above the mountains of Kashmir, Indiaa stunt marked by its balance of suspense amid beautiful scenery. Whats more, Cruise performs some extraordinary motorcycle work, becomes the first actor to perform a high-altitude skydive, and runs in a wowing extended pursuit (he has long been Hollywoods best runner). Any of these sequences is incomparable, and yet Fallout is filled with them. Then again, McQuarrie and the 56-year-old Cruise are unafraid to acknowledge that the star may be dimming. Opposite the broad-shouldered Cavill (todays Superman), who towers over Cruise, Hunt isnt the invincible hero he once was. In Fallout, hes out of his depth more than once, which, of course, makes the film all the more thrilling.

Over the course of six films, the Mission: Impossible franchise has remained mostly consistent (with the exception of the abominable second film by director John Woo), deepening its hold on viewers with each new entry. With Fallout, McQuarrie delivers not only the best film in the franchise after De Palmas slick original, but one of the great films of artfully photographed and technically monumental actionto be included on a list alongside other titles of similarly grand scope and design: The Road Warrior (1982), Aliens (1986), Die Hard (1988), Heat (1997), Skyfall (2012), and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). Above all, Fallout reminds us that neither Cruises talent nor the enduring quality of his Mission: Impossible films should be taken for granted. Each new sequel attempts something new, something weve never seen before, and does this with a sense of spy-thriller panache that no other action franchise has matched with such unbridled showmanship and consistent, keeps-you-guessing story. Audiences will be watching McQuarries direction and Cruises stuntwork for years to come, reflecting with a sense of awe over how they accomplished what they did, and how rare it is that the filmmakers took the risk to achieve it."
ARW_Doc5_MissionImpossibleFallout,Akshit Raja,Action,Positive,Mission Impossible Fallout,"The Mission: Impossible films have a pretty set formula at this point, to which Fallout adheres: there are numerous action sequences including fighting and hand-to-hand violence; some shoot-outs, one involving a sniper; car and helicopter crashes and chases; the threat of a nuclear attack; characters deaths; some cursing; and some flirting and sexual tension between a few characters.

Each Mission: Impossible franchise installment is crazier than the last, and Fallout is an enjoyable pinnacle of insanity. Weve seen Tom Cruise climb skyscrapers with no support gear, jump out of airplanes, run through sandstorms, and do whatever it takes to push his body to the limit, to portray IMF agent Ethan Hunt as the sole person who can save the world from imminent destruction. Fallout is more of the same, but this franchises pursuit of perfection makes each film feel distinct, separate, and explosively thrilling.

MissionImpossibleFallout ChesapeakeFamilyMovieReviewFallout picks up where 2015s Rogue Nation left off, in which IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise, of The Mummy) captures international terrorist and rogue operative Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Two years later, Lanes disciples of the group the Syndicate are now being referred to as the Apostles, and are committed to spreading paranoia, fear, and chaos throughout the world.

Theyre aided by people who are sympathetic to the idea of a nuclear war wiping out of most of civilization (Theres never been peace first without a great suffering is a line from one apocalyptic manifesto), and so it falls on Hunt and his team to track down three plutonium cores and recover them before they can fall into the wrong hands. But the IMF is also embroiled in an intergovernmental showdown with the CIA, and so Hunt is forced to work with CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill, of Justice League), an assassin who is tasked with monitoring his actions.

The next two hours are devoted to jumping out of airplanes, infiltrating exclusive parties with weapons dealers, breaking out prisoners, evading snipers, and double cross after double cross. The Mission: Impossible franchise has never shied away from goofy stuff like masks and play-acting to snag baddies, and so those more light-hearted elements are juxtaposed with action set pieces that are engaging and over-the-top. You think that car chase is going to wrap up? It keeps going! You think the dueling helicopers are going to run out of fuel? They dont! And the film also does a great job with its supporting actors, in particular Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan, and new franchise additions Vanessa Kirby and Angela Bassett, who round out the cast and all play off Cruise quite well.

This summer has had a lot of movies with visual spectacle, like Dwayne Johnsons Skyscraper and Marvels Ant-Man and the Wasp, but Mission: Impossible  Fallout is the one that draws you in the fastest, wrings you out with its intensity, and leaves you looking forward to the next go-round. Fallout is what happens when a franchise doesnt settle, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time."
ARW_Doc6_MissionImpossibleFallout,Akshit Raja,Action,Negative,Mission Impossible Fallout,"Mission: Impossible  Fallout had the best opening weekend of the entire series with $61.2 million (and another $94.6 million overseas). This is the film Tom Cruise broke his ankle on and the film Henry Cavill just had to have a mustache for that made those re-shoots for Justice League have such disastrous results. The sequel has a whopping 97% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 86 Metascore on Metacritic. Critics and the general movie-going audience emphatically and enthusiastically adore this film and personally it doesnt register why the Mission: Impossible franchise is so cherished by movie lovers.

Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, Sean Harris as villain Solomon Lane, and Rebecca Ferguson as former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust all return from Mission: Impossible  Rogue Nation; this is the first film where a director and a villain have returned from a previous film. The technical aspects of the film are the easiest to admire and the action sequences are outstandingly breathtaking. The big action sequences include the parachute/free fall sequence with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and August Walker (Henry Cavill), the bathroom brawl with Hunt, Walker, and John Lark, Hunts motorcycle chase, Hunt running and jumping across rooftops, and the insane helicopter chase.

Its ridiculous (in a good way) how much room cinematographer Rob Hardy (Annihilation, Ex Machina) gives each sequence; these are scenes made for seeing and experiencing in IMAX. You can tell that the majority of the stunts were pulled off practically and green screens and computer generated effects are utilized minimally. The most impressive sequence is the motorcycle chase because Tom Cruise races through the wrong side of traffic without a helmet in the circle around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

But the helicopter chase features Cruise climbing up a rope dangling in the air while the helicopter is airborne. These sequences are extremely open with perspectives that not only make you feel like youre with Tom Cruise being just as nuts and exhilarating as he is, but also seem to be making the statement that Cruise is still crazy enough to do the majority of his own stunts at the age of 56 despite his saggy jowls.

Many on social media were claiming that Mission: Impossible  Fallout is nonstop action over its nearly 150-minute runtime, but that doesnt seem to be the case. The film seems to be attempting this never ending adrenaline rush found within the likes of films like Mad Max: Fury Road and Speed, but it fails to do so. The action is superb, but everything in between is extraordinarily dull. Missing the first and third films in the franchise may have contributed to that, but theres not much to miss here if you havent seen the other films in the franchise.

Hunt obviously still cares about his ex-wife Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan), but currently has a connection with Ilsa Faust. The spy element of the sequel feels so clich and predictable as every twist and big reveal can easily be predicted even if this is your first Mission: Impossible film. The inclusion of a bomb in a Mission: Impossible film feels explosively juvenile at this point and you legitimately have no investment in these characters whatsoever.

With every Mission: Impossible film thats released, it seems like its main purpose is for Tom Cruise to be like Mad TVs Stuart and yell, Look what I can do! before partaking in extracurricular activities a man in his fifties should probably be distancing himself from. To be fair, Cruise is still more than capable of doing incredible action films and is generally a part of films that aim to be exciting for everyone.

Fallout is extraordinary if you scrutinize without any sort of context. The film knows how to make your pulse race and your palms sweat as you gasp for breath. But the story is the same as any other Mission: Impossible film and the sequel is basically dead as far as any sort of emotional acting goes. Theres no substance here and impressive action doesnt make up for a defused storyline."
ARW_Doc7_MissionImpossibleFallout,Akshit Raja,Action,Negative,Mission Impossible Fallout,"By now the entire world knows that Mission: Impossible  Fallout purports to be the most action-packed, breath-baiting movie ever made  or so advises film authorities who have unanimously given in to Hollywoods hard sell and given up on artistic standards. Every new blockbuster must be recognized as the acme of a genre  until the next one is hyped. A popular film series is now sacrosanct, especially when it is so clearly devised according to proven formula.

Back in 1996, when the first Mission: Impossible movie was nearing completion, I lucked upon the opportunity to ask director Brian De Palma how the production was going. Oh, you mean, Tom Cruises Mission Impossible! the demoralized maestro joked. Today, critics are not joking when they praise Fallout as the reason we go to the movies (an actual repeat of reviews for Peter Jacksons forgettable King Kong remake).

Fallout fits into that peculiar niche where lovers of both spy fiction and action fantasy are mutually satisfied with shameless appeals to their most banal interests. Only a media panderer could expect viewers to go along with yet another plot in which fearless agents foil an attempt to exterminate civilization while they also contend with the cautious, if not untrustworthy, bureaucracy that employs them. As expected, Cruises Ethan Hunt motivates his team (Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, and Henry Cavill) to go beyond the dictates of their officials, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin. Problem is, this stock storyline has already been enhanced  vivified and deepened  in Luc Bessons Transporter movies and Zack Snyders production of Suicide Squad. The standards of those films surpass the Mission: Impossible quasi-political, pseudo-kinetic brand.

We may think we know all about Tom Cruise, including his religion, but do we know his politics? Is he just a super capitalist? Or is he merely a cagey pop star with a hit-and-miss record? He has turned the Mission: Impossible movie franchise into such a heartless machine (coproduced by the juvenile J. J. Abrams) that Fallouts big, elaborate set-pieces conflate perpetual motion with religious ritual, and overstimulation comes across as the politics of a capitalist who fools himself  and his consumers  into thinking that violence is creativity.

Its not a sign of good culture or good politics that theres complete media consent on Fallouts, relentless, can-you-top-this? action scenes, even praising Cruises risky, ping-pong ball existentialism. Eyes wide open, minds shut.

What does this installments doomsday plot say about our culture (obsessed with paramilitary and civilian violence) and our politics (obsessed with controlling government oversight)? The fawning media never bothers to ask Cruise whether his intentions are apolitical. Besides, the movies say more than he could explain or justify about peddling a globally addicting drug.

Conservative or liberal, we all should have a problem with Fallouts pandering to our insensitivity  and confusing emotional numbness with cartoon aesthetics. The old James Bond movies used to open with spectacular stunt sequences that now are just regular fodder in the Mission: Impossible franchise. The director Christopher McQuarrie flaunts his perverse sadistic technique, spawn from the Tarantino principle that violence is cool.

De Palmas Mission: Impossible elevated generic TV into visually sumptuous and kinetic cinema 22 years ago. Why should we accept a film that is nothing more than action-movie diversion? McQuarries hell-bent style even diverges from the ingenuity that distinguished the franchises best film, Ghost Protocol, which went beyond spy fiction to feature palpable pangs of love and revenge, especially as acted by former teammate Paula Patton, who infused the narrative with sensuality and a grieving womans passion. In Fallout, McQuarrie treats Hunts encounter with his wife (Michelle Monaghan) as no more than a footnote.

After Cruise worked with De Palma and Ghost Protocols Brad Bird, its alarming to see partnership with the much less talented McQuarrie on four films so far. When reviewing McQuarries unpromising 2000 directorial debut The Way of the Gun, I had major qualms:

McQuarries characters dont represent any social anxiety, just the adolescent fantasy of fun violence. Ignoring the [storys] sting of death and loss, McQuarrie has the temerity to treat it simply as thrill.

This venality is essentially all McQuarrie contributes to the Mission: Impossible franchise. It has become the basis of Cruises triumph over a vicious and vindictive industry and its media acolytes who hate him yet worship the money he can bring in.

All the Mission: Impossible films are too long, and none have the cultural essence of last years quasi-political Cruise epic American Made. Schlockmeister McQuarrie lacks the moral sense to make Fallouts nonstop violence meaningful. Every fight and chase sequence ends with moral deflation, not the abstract, surrealist humor and magic of Buster Keaton or James Bond vintage. The films physical and emotional peak  featuring Cruise and Henry Cavills two-on-one brawl with a foreign agent (Liang Yang), which demolishes a gleaming white lavatory  fails to rouse the storys issues or inspire reflection, even though Cavills hypermasculine jacket-toss and shoulder flex briefly startles the senses. An action scene is not outstanding if thats all it is. Have we learned nothing from Eisenstein, Ford, Kurosawa, Peckinpah, Spielberg, Hill, Megaton, Bay, and the Chinese masters, who, lately, have been kicking Hollywoods butt?

Each successive Mission: Impossible movie takes us further away from understanding the politics and morality of espionage. Cruises determination to conquer Hollywood through his own pyrrhic command of formula teaches a lesson that this sequel glides by. But it was articulated in last years Rogue Nation: There are no allies in statecraft, just common interests. That line sums up Fallouts pop culture and political commitment."
ARW_Doc8_MissionImpossibleFallout,Akshit Raja,Action,Negative,Mission Impossible Fallout,"In his 1846 essay The Present Age, Sren Kierkegaard decried the widespread tendency of the timewhich he summed up as an age without passionto transform daring and enthusiasm into a feat of skill. Im not sure that these observations apply to the modern public at large, but they certainly account in significant measure for the peculiar critical acclaim that Mission: ImpossibleFallout, written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, has been garnering. The filmthe sixth in the Mission: Impossible seriesis intelligently made, but its display of intelligence is an equivocal virtue. Its feat of cinematic engineering invites admiration for its engineering: the infrastructure is on the outside, the seemingly tenuous threads that dangle its dramatic pendants are on view, and the delights that it offers are those of a production video, showcased not in a behind-the-scenes reel but throughout the movie itself.

While viewers are having their sensibilities dunned and stunned by infotainment tales of this movies feat of skill, the critical community rushes to search for continuity between its cinematic spectacle and the classical era of filmmaking. The widely ballyhooed details of Tom Cruises readiness to perform his own dangerous and difficult stunts conjures, to the public, a sense of satisfaction regarding the pains that a fabulously rich and famous person is willing to take for their pleasures; for critics, it evokes an age of artistic heroism harking back to Buster Keatons and Harold Lloyds self-sacrificing stunts. But the knowledge that Cruise takes the risk of doing his own stunts is insignificant from a cinematic perspective unless hes filmed in a way that emphasizes his physical commitmentand the productions dependence on his physical commitment. Instead, theres little in Mission: ImpossibleFallout to suggest that Cruise wasnt mashed up via C.G.I. with stunt performers onto whose physiques his face and voice were superimposed. To complete the sense of a nostalgia trip for tradition-hungry critics, the movie was shot on 35-mm. film, not digital video. This, too, doesnt matter at alltheres hardly a visual sensibility detectible anywhere in the movie, not an image with any resonance or overtone beyond the transparent conveyance of the scripted action.

These action scenes arent intimate or precise. They are, by and large, smearythe idea of their cumulative mechanisms, their plotting, the payoff that results, overrides any single image by which theyre realized. Yet at the same time theyre not filmed with any conspicuous cinematic impressionism or subjective fragmentation. They seem intended, rather, to deliver an illusion of thoroughness, of completeness, of spectacular exhaustiveness, that no individual image suggests on its own. Theres a great deal of tumult and thrashing in the action sequences but little sense of dynamic stillness; here, when theres no onscreen agitation, theres merely nothing happening. Nowhere in the movies gargantuan churn is there a single moment of astonishing grace to rival Cruises cable-dangling backflip in the first Mission: Impossible, directed by Brian De Palma.

The intricate plot of Mission: ImpossibleFallout has a miniseries-like surplus of twists that are rooted in elaborate deceptions and false identities. The movies MacGuffin is a trio of metallic spheres, about the size of bocce balls, that contain plutonium and are adorned with gizmos to plug them catastrophically into detonators. The terroristic villains who seek it sound more like a couple of British Invasion bandsSolomon Lane and the Apostles, John Lark and the Syndicatebut theres nothing entertaining about their intentions. With the help of a rogue nuclear scientist, theyre planning to commit mass nuclear murderand Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his closest associates in the Impossible Missions Force, Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames), stage a meeting with the plutonium-ball sellers but are ambushed."
ARW_Doc9_MissionImpossibleFallout,Akshit Raja,Action,Negative,Mission Impossible Fallout,"MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE sequels now arrive with such regularity (every 4-5 years) that I cant recall what number this one is.  Like THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, its become a very expensive serial.  Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt.  He and his team, a menagerie now reduced to Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), must exchange a rogue agent for stolen plutonium to prevent its use by a terrorist group known as The Apostles.

Brian De Palmas 1996 screen take on Bruce Gellers television series followed closely in the footsteps of Phil Alden Robinsons sleeper hit, SNEAKERSa light-footed spy thriller with touches of intrigue and comedy.  The genre shifted away from the cold-war sensibilities of Clancy/Le Carr in post-Schwarzenegger Hollywood, leaning more heavily on action and save-the-world plots.  Enter John Woo and an A-list of other action directors for the M:I sequels.

Not one to argue with a tentpole formula, Tom Cruise leapt into the chasm, opting to do his own stunts (wrong for all sorts of reasons) and here we are: Action sequences so intense and dizzying, the audience isnt given time to think, But why is there a long, external hose connecting his oxygen tank to his mask?  It seems as if the thing was designed with the sole purpose of getting caught on something. But never mind

The film achieves most of its near-intrigue by including elements recycled from De Palmas smarter, inaugural entry in the franchiseconflicting priorities with a CIA agent (Henry Cavill as August Walker, the funniest cover name since Fat Bastard), an alluring, rich-as-shit broker played by a VanessaKirby, in this case; the character is the grand-niece of the other Vanessas (Redgrave) Max.  The film contains every staple of every contemporary action film in the spy genre: the Deal Gone Bad, the Brokered Negotiation, the Nightclub Scene With Lasers, the Double-Cross and the Double-Double Cross.

And who thought it would be a good idea to cast Tom Cruise against Henry Cavill?  Two black holes of charisma for the price of one!  Cavill is unbelievably handsome, but that just adds to the placidity of his acting.  The film tries, desperately, to testosteronify Cruises Huntcasting him betwixt Kirbys White Widow and Rebecca Fergusons Ilsa Faust.   But it doesnt really work.  All the sexual tension could have been squared between Cavill and Cruise, but two black holes dont make a shining star.

By contrast, what Christian Bale once described as Cruises intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes played well in De Palmas M:I and Michael Manns COLLATERAL.  In both films, the story capitalized on Mr. Mapothers soulless stare in characters appropriately lacking a moral center.  Watch the HBO documentary MANHUNT, about the CIA team that located Bin Laden, led by Marty Martin who was reportedly ejected from the Agency for, among other things, embezzling $6 million.  Its a dirty job  Ethan Hunt is played as an incorruptible man with an unwavering moral compass, when he should be less like Captain America and more like Vincent in Manns film.

Cruise tries his damnedest to make sense of his macho brand in the 21st century against the more affable personalities in Luther and Benji, the exhaustion of keeping up the faade now visible in his 56-year old face.  Im not arguing here that hes old, but that the brand hes built around himself is an anachronism an anachronism that worked for his character arc in Doug Limans EDGE OF TOMORROW, because he had a competing personality against whom to push (a no-bullshit Emily Blunt).

Aside from the familiar scaffolding, the film holds up well as an action piece, but the intrigue dissolves when we step outside the theater and read about the clandestine way 12 Russian military intelligence officers were caught in the act intefering in the 2016 U.S. Elections.  Truth isnt just stranger than fiction, its also more terrifying and exhilarating For the past year, its been the biggest show on Earth.  How do you compete with that?"
ARW_Doc10_MissionImpossibleFallout,Akshit Raja,Action,Negative,Mission Impossible Fallout,"Picture the scene. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), the pride of the Impossible Missions Force, jumps out of a plane with his moustachioed CIA minder, Walker (Henry Cavill). After freefalling a few thousand feet, one of them is struck by lightning, and there is lots of mid-air hurly-burly with oxygen canisters and parachutes. The stunt work and filming are hugely impressive, and if the two hunky heroes were hurtling towards a villains hidden fortress or escaping from a flock of hang-gliding assassins, then the scene would be thrilling, too.

But they arent. What theyre doing is  wait for it  going to a disco in the centre of Paris. A disco. So was a parachute jump really the most surreptitious and practical way for our super spies to get there? Of course not, but Christopher McQuarrie, the films writer-director, must have realised that if Ethan had taken the Metro to the club there might have been a gap of more than five minutes between action sequences  and there was no way he was going to let that happen.

Welcome to Mission: Impossible  Fallout, the sixth film in the series, and the second in a row to have been made by McQuarrie. His mission, and he certainly chose to accept it, was to make this instalment the most action-packed of them all, and so one adrenalised, elaborate set piece follows another, for a bum-numbing two-and-a-half hours, whether there is any logic behind those set pieces or not. I suppose there is a plot threading them together, but Im not sure what it is.

Its got something to do with three plutonium cores which have been stolen by a band of terrorists called The Apostles. (They are essentially the same terrorists who were called The Syndicate in the previous film, but theyve rebranded themselves and presumably updated their website accordingly.) To get the plutonium back, Ethan has to schmooze a fixer named the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby, ie, Princess Margaret from The Crown), a coolly mischievous femme fatale who deserved a lot more screen time than she gets, and who is no relation to Scarlett Johanssons character in The Avengers.

As usual, Hunt is aided and abetted by his two adoring sidekicks, the nervous boffin Benji (Simon Pegg) and the less nervous boffin Luther (Ving Rhames), who provide some amusing odd-couple banter. But the CIAs boss (Angela Bassett) has insisted that Walker tag along, much to the annoyance of Ethans own boss, Hunley (Alec Baldwin). Then theres Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), Ethans old MI6 flame, and Ethans wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan), and Solomon (Sean Harris), the rat-like baddie from the last film. But youd need one of the IMFs amazingly reliable tablets to keep track of whos who, and whose side theyre all on.  

Basically, whenever they get together for a chat, the villains say that the heroes have fallen into a trap, and the heroes reply that, no, the villains have fallen into a trap, and then a villain pulls off a rubber mask to reveal that he is actually a hero, and then everyone agrees that it is time for a shoot-out. Starting off as a glamorously retro European espionage caper, with an undercurrent of doom and a grandiose reference to Homers The Odyssey, the film soon shoves aside coherent storytelling in favour of protracted fights and chases, as Ethan hops from Berlin to Paris to London to Kashmir, perpetually in search of things to climb up, run along, and jump off.

Its a brawn-over-brain affair. Whereas previous Missions were sometimes about being cleverer than the villains, this one is principally about being tougher and more determined. The main theme is that if you grit your teeth and stare so intently at your target that your eyes almost pop out of your skull, then you can somehow will yourself to victory  assuming, of course, you are as indestructible as Ethan. Although he isnt officially a mutant or an alien, he can be thrown off a motorcycle at top speed, with no crash helmet on, and be fit as a fiddle a moment later.

This invulnerability cant help but make Fallout less involving. If you were to judge the film according to the effort that has gone into planning and executing its increasingly spectacular and ludicrous action sequences, you could hail Mission: Impossible  Fallout as a masterpiece (as several critics have). Cruise does his own stunts, and his steely commitment to all the rope-swinging and rooftop-leaping is remarkable, especially bearing in mind that he is now 56, and must have been swigging from the fountain of youth between takes.

But if you judge the film according to how exciting those action sequences are, then Fallout falls short. However technically miraculous a helicopter dogfight or a multi-vehicle heist may be, it cant really get the blood pumping or the sweat flowing if its tone isnt consistent, and McQuarrie keeps wobbling between winking self-parody and apocalyptic seriousness. It cant quite deliver, either, if it doesnt have an interesting villain, or quotable dialogue, or a compelling narrative reason to happen  which brings us back to the aforementioned parachute jump. More importantly, the impact of these sequences is cushioned by having a hero who isnt a human being.

Ethans buddies keep telling us what a good man Ethan is, and McQuarrie gives him some bad dreams to assure us that he has an inner life. But even after six films, its hard to warm to this invincible robot as much as you might warm to James Bond or Jason Bourne. Can you enjoy his knockabout adventures? Definitely. But can you care about them? Impossible."
SRB_Doc1_IT,SRB,Horror,Positive,IT,"It takes the simplistic world of 1989 and twists it upside down to a disturbance-filled land of absolute craziness. The film does not get anything amiss in all departments. The script is very well written and has a lot of aspects that support the overall vibe of the horror flick. There are many lines in It that bequeath an impact after the viewing is over. The themes of youth and individuality loom over the film in such a tangible way. The screenwriters also handle most of the film's characters well. A lot of the characters have strong character development with good backstories to strengthen their actions. The two characters I would say have trouble connecting with the rest of the story are Mike and Henry. Both characters do not feel strong enough to grasp their goals. Mike is better than the two named, yet he still feels disconnected from the rest of The Losers Club. Henry makes no sense by the 3rd act of the film and seems a bit off from where one would expect him to be. The film also runs for a bit too long as it gets slow in the second act. Having the movie be under the 120-minute mark would have made the film feel more like a continuous flowing story. Andy Muschietti holds the reins on the film as the director and does a pretty solid job. Muschietti has a lot of innovation when it comes to the environment Pennywise lives in. However, the imagination of Muschietti does not feel right visually. The film looks and feels like A Nightmare on Elm Street, yet it does not have that same surprise factor as the film mentioned. Pennywise is great, but having it be a bit more spontaneous would have made the film feel more elevated. The cinematography also suffers from this problem. Chung-hoon Chung is not wrong with his work. However, it does feel a little constrained and repetitive at times. The most shining visual aspect of It is the production and set design. The art direction combined with the stunning sets and locations is outstanding and helps hide some of the other visual flaws. The cast of It is the most compelling component of the film and makes it what it is. Bill Skarsgrd is jaw-dropping in the film. His performance of Pennywise shapes the movie so astonishingly well. When Skarsgrd first speaks in that opening sequence, it sets a chilling, disturbing tone. Skarsgrd keeps that tone throughout the whole film. Jaeden Lieberher leads The Losers Club and honors that title in his performance. His sentiments shine bright in the third act, and he does not disappoint. Sophia Lillis was also such a powerhouse as she portrayed Beverly in such a powerful way. Jeremy Ray Taylor's performance was loaded with emotion and sometimes hard to watch as he made his actions feel very real. Finn Wolfhard and Jack Dylan Grazer are the funniest out of everyone in the cast and have a lot of great lines that stick throughout the film. Lastly, we have Chosen Jacobs and Wyatt Oleff. Both have solid line delivery and needed to be on screen more often. It is disturbing yet holds a strong message with incredible themes that make the film feel comprehensive and modern. The influential performances from all the cast members hide the slight script problems and lackluster visuals at times. In the end, It will surely make you think twice about ever wanting to see a clown in person. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com"
SRB_Doc2_IT,SRB,Horror,Positive,IT,"Don't dive too deep into this review or you'll float too IT was first a horror novel created by Stephan Kings. It was first filmed in 1990. The series managed to survive for a long time, yet IT was long overdue for a fresh remake. Twenty-seven years later, the creators focused on the first IT movie directed by Andy Muschietti and owned by Warner Bros Pictures. It is a story in a place named Derry where seven children where terrorized by their personal demons. They see their demons that keep following them, so they will have to shoot into action to put an end to it. The group of kids are getting more and more connected to be able to beat it. But what is IT and where does IT come from... The seven young main characters who called themselves the Loser Club', all had their own problems. Each character is so different, you really notice how each individual handles the situation differently. It's nice to see all kinds of different character traits in one group. This horror movie also contains good humor which was very nice to see, humor was shown when you would least expect it. It probably has a big budget because of all the effects and details that the images contained. As far as technology goes, it was very good because everything looked very realistic. Countering the standard horror is an unusual sense of adventure, which plays nicely against the powerful courage of the kids. Based on the novel, a red balloon floating in mid air was the mysterious evil entity that haunts, traps and kills the kids in Derry. In the book, it was shown how difficult it was to get out of the sewer while that situation was not shown in the movie. It was very clear that the book is about adults while the movie is about young people. To the use of children in the movie, the movie can be watched by a wider audience. I already said too much, I will leave it at that. The book has much more details about how everything is put together. Everything is told in much more structured and thorough way. The ending was a little different than in the movie. But that is also because the book was about adults and not children. Andy Muschietti is not only the director of IT but also of the movie Mama. Mama is a great movie. Other than being a horror movie it is also a movie with a wonderful story behind it. The movie Mama is a little bit based on drama in the end. You can see that the director has a lot of creativity and is very good at directing movies. If I may be honest I think IT is better a better movie just because it contains some humour. It also contains more like love and young people's daily drama. But that is also nice to see and that is also what makes it all so more realistic. If you like to see horror movies that still contains more than just horror, this is a good movie to watch. You can read the book if you want but you don't need to read the book to watch the movie. If you are interested in how different the book is then I definitely recommend the book. It's kind of fun to see how different the book and the movie are. I enjoyed this movie a lot. Of course I also enjoyed the second movie because yes, there is a second movie. You can watch that one too, because there the adventure goes much further than you think."
SRB_Doc3_IT,SRB,Horror,Positive,IT,"Just got back from seeing 'IT'. Expectations were that of great interest but also apprehension. Eight years ago, back when there was a personal unfamiliarity and ignorance of Stephen King's style and less appreciation for the book, there is the admission of saying don't bother with a re-make. Couldn't be more wrong. This was a case where another adaptation was not only warranted but necessary. 'IT' is such a great story that deserves to be done justice and with one of the best trailers of the year this actually looked good. However, with the other King film released this year 'The Dark Tower' being such a disappointment, there was apprehension as to whether a film based on such a huge book would work. 'IT' as a book is one of King's best and one of the best of the horror genre. King's attention to detail, how he writes scenes with children and depiction of fear are unparalleled, with wonderfully drawn characters, one of the terrifying antagonists in literature and many unforgettable scenes, ones that burn long in the memory in how scary they are. The book is much more than just a horror story though, also with nostalgia, comedy, pathos and deep characterisation. 'IT' was previously adapted as a mini-series in 1990, which is remembered fondly by those who saw it as children and left them terrified but often derided by fans of the book. To me, it has a lot wrong with it with a vastly inferior second half and an anti-climactic let down of an ending with the infamously terrible effects of IT's true form. But it is nowhere near one of the worst King adaptations, it's not even the worst of the mini-series. Compared to the book it's very poor, as a standalone it's wildly uneven but has more to it than Tim Curry's unforgettably magnificent Pennywise. It has a great first half with strong performances from the child actors, some unsettling moments, a 'Stand By Me'-like nostalgia and a great music score. This 2017 film adaptation is a big improvement and one of the best King adaptations in years. It does have changes, including the change in decade, not following the same structure, different IT encounters for some characters and another motivation for wanting to defeat IT. However, it is very loyal in spirit to the book that is apparent throughout. What makes it better are better production values, explanations and character motivations being more logical, Henry Bowers being more of a psychopath (and he is given a reason for why he came to be the way he is, when it was only implied once in passing previously), Beverly's father and the relationship between the two having more of a creep factor and even better child performances. Not without its faults. Not all the special effects work, the fangs and the overdone Pennywise shaking look cheap. Mike is underused and underdeveloped compared to the others and the other bullies are pretty much given short shrift (Victor Criss practically anonymous). Some people have said that 'IT' is not scary. Personally disagree, finding it one of the scariest films seen in a long time. Not many films recently made my heart jump, covering my eyes, biting nails or stifling a scream. The Niebolt Street, bathroom, George and Pennywise and photograph/slideshow scenes especially are absolutely terrifying, and there are beautifully timed jolts, real tension and eeriness and suspenseful lead-ups, aided by atmospheric intricate lighting and clever effects for IT's forms (that leper!). With that being said, 'IT' is much more than a horror film, and is more successful in its other elements. It has comedy, and it's hilarious especially with Richie and Eddie. There is an affectionate nostalgia, reminiscent of 'Stand By Me' and 'The Goonies' and reminding one of how good King was at writing scenes with children and childhood adolescence, which the writers understood and it translates brilliantly on screen. There is pathos, like with Ben's poem and the two most heart-wrenching moments are in the frightening, heart-tugging and triumphant climax. The characters are written very well on the most part, particularly Bill, Beverly and Ben, while Pennywise is evil-incarnate. Production values mostly are terrific, not just the lighting but also the beautifully realised Derry setting (Niebolt Street is a standout), taut editing and cinematography that's both stunning and unnerving. The effects mostly are not bad, the make-up is superb and how Pennywise is made up has a creepier effect. The music score is truly haunting, ""Oranges and Lemons"" has never freaked me out this much. Andy Muschietti directs with suspense, potent realism, confidence and affection, while the writing has a great balance of hilarious comedy, touching drama and pathos, references to the time period, King and history of Derry and nostalgia. The story, even with the change of time-line and structure, is cohesive and logical, rich in suspense and emotion but it's the chemistry between the children and the sweet and surprisingly real relationship between Beverly and Ben that resonate most. One couldn't ask for better performances. The children are uniformly wonderful, especially a vulnerable Sophia Lillis, a hilarious Finn Wolfhard and a relatable Jeremy Ray Taylor. Jaeden Lieberher handles Bill's dramatic arc very touchingly while Jack Dylan Grazer is very funny. Mike and Stan are well cast. As for Pennywise, it is a very difficult feat filling the iconic Tim Curry's giant clown shoes, but Bill Skarsgard does so superbly, providing a different interpretation that never feels like a copy and has just as much chilling menace, nightmarish air and dark twisted amusement. Curry's laugh is creepier, but Skarsgard's is closer to that described in the book. All in all, brilliant and if the second film with the adults happens please have the same writer, director and Skarsgard on board, and use this as a model rather than the mini-series' second half with better cast adults and a far better ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
SRB_Doc4_IT,SRB,Horror,Positive,IT,"Monsters come in many forms, as does fear. Isolation, the supernatural, stumbling below expectations can scare us and come to be our demons. These uncertainties claw their way through the frames of IT-figuratively and literally as nothing is sacred and no one is safe. The necessity of dependable friendships is the only refuge from the naked terror that Pennywise and the children's parents put them through. Morphing real-life horror with unexplained, other-worldly menace, they challenge the ragtag group of friends dubbed ""The Loser's Club"" at every turn. The story of IT has been imprinted in the American zeitgeist and young children's minds. It surrounds bullied young outcasts as they deal with the underlying evil of their seemingly tranquil small town Derry, Maine. But billowing from beneath this suburban town is a conspiracy of murder, destruction and missing children-more so than any other town nearby. The gang of kids are forced investigate the source of the menace when one of their own, Bill, kid brother Georgie goes missing. The kids decide if the adults aren't going to quell the evil within, they must try, and embark on an adventure of ramshackle houses, sewer pipes and strange phantoms as they confront their greatest personal terrors. When I first saw the trailer for IT I thought it looked great but unsustainable. There have been plenty of trailers for horror films that build up expectations and promptly jam a sharp middle finger up in the air, replacing directorial patience with jump-scares. This film does not. It takes it's time to develop characters, shape tension, and probe questions about undiscovered fear-real and abstract. The monsters in the film become anything we don't want to approach-the stranger lurking in the blackness, the abusive father or overbearing mother, or losing a loved one--and our inability to combat these fears will only cripple our growth and nourish our demons. That is not to say the film is not a complete masterpiece. I have minor quibbles with the overuse of score and sound effects to emphasize scares and I blame that mainly on the time in which it has been released than the fault of the filmmaker's, however, it does not completely ruin the film. Eyeful direction, multifaceted performances, and authentic relationships are carefully earned, dragging IT from the gutter of mainstream horror that often plagues theaters to set it apart. The real standout performer of the gang is Sophia Lillis as Beverly who has a lot of dramatic baggage to shoulder and gives a nuanced performance. The torture of adolescence throughout shares more with Stand By Me-although severely more grisly child murder-than something like Texas Chainsaw as you learn to care for these outcasts. You are inadvertently adopted as another member into The Loser's Club, rooting for them to prevail over their adolescent woes, their abusive parents and impalpable supernatural evil. Where sloppier films devolve into a series of disconnected cheap scares, IT uses inspired imagery to challenge characters while simultaneously adding to their development as people. Genuine dialogue and humor swell complexity among The Loser's Club, elevating a film from slasher to a more nuanced, almost Spielbergian coming-of-age adventure film. The love for eighties nostalgia floods this film (originally set in the 50's in the novel) and allows for fresh places to be explored. This renewed retelling of the IT mythology unearths surprises for those familiar with the novel, leaving plenty to discover, while still retaining its emotional core with characters that are likable and feel like real people. IT is an engaging, thrilling and more often fun retelling of the classic Stephen King tale and one of the best adaptations of his works."
SRB_Doc5_IT,SRB,Horror,Positive,IT,"Stephen King.is an undisputed master of horror with an oeuvre encompassing success in literature, film, and television. While a certain radio shack jock has proclaimed himself 'King of all Media' that honorific is more appropriately applied to the native son of Maine, Stephen King. Several of his best-selling novels has been transformed into movies there is a problem inherent to the transformation process. His works are exceptionally rich in character development and exposition. His novels have the propensity for being thicker than the typical paperback, a quality my late wife and I would look for on our personal reading list. Two of the best translations of M King's tales of terror were made into miniseries, 'The Stand' and 'It,' they have played a significant role in defining the bar of excellence for the format. Longer than the typical movie they allowed for sufficient details to justice to his works. Those in the audience afflicted with coulrophobia, the intense fear of clowns, the miniseries of 'It' was the ideal way telling this incredible horror story, that spans childhood to be an adult. In remaking the story as a film, Warner Brothers had the wisdom and respect for the author and fans to split the story into two films. Lately, this has become very popular in franchises as an acceptable way to transform the final novel in the series. This film concentrates on the protagonist as children with the upcoming sequel resuming the narrative 27 years later. The miniseries had achieved cult status leaving many to doubt its potential success; those fears were dissipated after an opening domestic weekend achieving the largest box office record for any Horror film with 117.1 million dollar opening weekend. Retelling a story that has become an integral part of the zeitgeist of a generation id exceptionally difficult, but Andy Muschietti does so with panache infusing the production with his stylistic flair. His previous film and first in English, 'Mama,' was quickly embraced by the devotees of horror. In many respects, he was able to remain close to the book, particularly in manifesting a properly dark and foreboding atmosphere. Crucial to this was assembling an ensemble cast of spectacular tween and teen talent. Most will represent new faces for the viewer, but after the phenomenal success for youthful stories including this film and the Netflix original series, 2017 was dominated by the youth of Hollywood. Beginning with the perspective of the heroes as tweens, the story returns to October 1968. Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher) is a teenager who is looked up to by his younger brother, Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott Jackson Robert Scott). To keep his brother entertained on a rainy afternoon, Bill fashions a boat out of a sheet of newspaper. Excited with his new toy Georgie goes outside to play with it in the rain sailing it in the gutter. The current is swift pulling the papercraft into a storm drain. Reaching down to retrieve his big brother's gift the boy encounters a clown who introduces himself as Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill Skarsgrd). Enticing the boy with the iconic line, ""We all float down here,"" he rips Georgie's off while pulling him down into the dark, depths of the sewer. The small town of Derry, Maine life moved forward towards summer. After school let out for vacation Bill, a budding writer and stutter are joined by several other social outcasts. Class clown, Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), momma's boy Stan Uris (Wyatt Oleff), hypochondriac, Eddie Kaspbrak (Eddie Kaspbrak), join as 'the Loser Club,' ostensibly to present a united front against the school bully, Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) and his gang of toadies. Bowers is the prototypical small-town bully intimidating younger and tormenting younger, smaller kids. Apart they were easy prey for Bowers but together as the Loser's Club the own their disenfranchised social status and are strong enough to resist. The Loser's aren't complete yet. A new kid moves into town, Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor). Being the new kid is usually relegating the kid to a low rung on the social ladder but add overweight, shy and studious to the mix and it is a certain recipe to become bully bait. The final charter member of the Loser's Club is Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis). When victimized by bully's girls have a particularly difficult time. The attacks often extend reputation destroying innuendo. In this instance, the rumor mill has branded Beverly as a slut. The truth is she is a victim at home as well as school. Her father sexually abuses Beverly on a regular basis. A TV-14 miniseries would not be able to broach this issue, especially in 1990. The advantage of an R rated movie is the mature content, and full gravitas of the situations can be explored. This might be a foreign concept to the Millennial generation, but studious, introverted kids frequently found refuge in the library. Surrounded by quiet and information on a plethora of topic it was a place of safety and comfort. Ben felt that way, and as he investigated previous missing children in Derry, he uncovered a terrible trend. Every 27 years children completely disappear. By digging deeper into the town's legends and folklore a creature called 'It' or frequently 'Pennywise the Dancing Clown,' which when sated returns to its dormant state of hibernation. It uses the town's sewers to move around undetected, but the center of its activity seems to be the creepy, dilapidated old house located at 29 Neibolt Street. One of the best moments of the film occurs when the Club goes to Its lair to confront it. After eons of hunting, Pennywise is a virtuoso fear playing upon each Loser focusing on their most sensitive and vulnerable. For Bill the creature taunts him about Georgie's fate, placing the blame on Bill. The cohesiveness of the group wanes leaving only Bill, and Beverly resolved to see the mission through to the banishment of Pennywise. The miniseries had been considered the definitive treatment of this classic horror story for 27 years. Considering the importance of that anniversary, within the context of the story, it is only fitting that a reimagined Pennywise dance out from the storm drain. Tim Curry is an incredible actor with an eclectic range. He had practice with the sinister smile from his tenure as Dr. Frank-N-Furter morphing it into the creepiest way possible to deliver the line ""we all float down here'. Bill Skarsgrd has also had considerable experience playing a monster. For three seasons he portrayed Roman Godfrey, the vampire-like creature called an Upir. He time on 'Hemlock Grove' was all too brief, but his presentation of the upper-class monster was exceptionally intense. This must be a family trait, his older brother, Alexander, played an old millennial vampire for seven years on 'True Blood.' Bill Skarsgrd is not only talented he is a consummate professional. Knowing his role was already ironically set in the fans he wisely sought to make the character completely his own. The result was a performance worthy of lasting praise. Of course, the true stars of the film are the young actors playing the Losers Club. A stand out performance was delivered by Finn Wolfhard who is already a familiar face in horror thanks to his work on the Netflix original series, 'Stranger Things.' His range is showcased as he does what a professional in his craft must, seamlessly moving from the introspective Mike Wheeler to the loud Richie Tozier. Like the one young woman in the cast Sophia Lillis, it unmatched in her nuanced performance as Beverly. For young talent, she possesses a deep emotional reservoir that enabled to play such a damage girl not as a victim but as a survivor. The seven young stars will be prominently featured in the upcoming Part 2; I am looking forward to how the characters are shared with their adult counterparts. This is an example of a reimagining that deserved it time in the spotlight."
SRB_Doc6_IT,SRB,Horror,Negative,IT,"It (2017) is the latest iteration based on Stephen King's bestselling novel about an evil force that takes the shape of your worst fears, primarily a clown, and the group of small-town kids left to fight it. The story has always had childhood close to its heart, and how our past haunts or future, but the film adaptations have always struggled to balance the horror and heart of Stephen King's 1000-page doorstopper. Director Andy Muschietti (Mama, 2013) is admirable in his attempts at the latter here, but fails when it comes to the scares. The film's closest sibling is Stand by Me, and like that film, it's the spirit of a group of kids overcoming bullies and monsters that strikes the loudest chord. Honestly, the end result is a real mixed bag. There are standout performances from Bill Skarsgrd as the iconic Pennywise, who is mostly successful in putting his own stamp on the legendary pop-culture monster. Both child leads are good, Jaeden Martell as the stuttering Bill, and, particularly, Sophia Lillis as Beverley. Bill is the one that brings the gang together and leads the mission to confront Pennywise in an ancient haunted house, a setting that unfortunately falls prey to all the trappings of those horror films. Bill is struggling with the death of his little brother and the final standoff with Pennywise is disappointingly average. Despite this, Lillis embodies Beverley with the perfect balance of vulnerability and fierceness that make her abusive home all the more affecting because, really, that's a far scarier place for her than an ancient evil that eats children. The trials and tribulations of being a kid is the side of the film that Muschietti gets right, and it's also the side of the book that readers connect with the most. My favourite part in the whole film is in the beginning when little Georgie is creeping down into his basement, frightened by the shadows of lamps that look like evil eyes in the darkuntil switched on. This is something we can all relate to. Even the dark corridors of our homes are scary as kids. A pity, then, that the film goes on to forget this. Visually, it is better than its 1990 predecessor, and it is, for the most part, better acted too  with a few exceptions that I'll explore later. I also don't mind how Pennywise looks here, creepy in a campy sense, like an evil bunny, it's a fun performance  and there's the biggest problem, this is supposed to be a horror film, it's supposed to be a childhood nightmare. It's not. Having good special effects doesn't mean you should use them. The original It (1990) got on fine without them. It scared children out of their minds. It sure as hell got under my skin when I first saw Tim Curry's awful sad face and toothy grin. I can't say the same for this modern Pennywise. The whole film reeks of modern horror and lacks any staying power. It's immediately forgettable, which is a shame given the cultural significance of the story here. Our first introduction to Pennywise is delightfully crafted, almost taken perfectly from the opening pages of King's novel, but it turns out that a clown amped up with shape-shifting special effects isn't sustainable, and Skarsgrd's impact falls flatter with each passing scene  no fault of his performance, there's only so much terrifying Skarsgrd can achieve when he's being squashed and transformed into a various monstrosities. A library scene involving a zombie chasing Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor) is funny instead of frightening, and so to when Pennywise begins to dance in the sewers. Other members of the Losers' Club include comedian Richie (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer) as the germophobe, and Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff) as a Jewish outcast. None of them are developed beyond their archetypes. The worst offender is Finn Wolfhard as Richie, whose sole purpose in the film is to spout crass mum jokes. Look, I know that's how kids talk, but the writers are insulting their audience here. It's so dumb. He's a good actor as shown in his breakthrough season of Stranger Things (2016-), but since then, even in subsequent seasons, he's drifted further away from the honest innocence that made him such a breath of fresh air. I hope he finds better roles and rediscovers his form soon, perhaps he'll be better in the upcoming Goldfinch (2019) film. Alongside Pennywise, the film is intercut with secondary horror threat in school bully Henry Bowers (played with excessive eagerness by Nicholas Hamilton). His scream of rage after being unable to carve his name into the nerdy Ben comes across as preposterous even in a film with a shapeshifting clown. The film is quite long, or rather, it feels long, and doesn't know what to do when Pennywise isn't dominating the frame, so when there's a lull in tension, Henry is thrown into the mix to create chaos, whether he's trying to kill Mike (Chosen Jacobs) in a hashed, thinly written racial commentary of 1960s America or murdering his own abusive father and becoming the ultimate Antichrist. It's not great and it makes the film a slog. None of the threats in the film come across the way they're intended  everything is telegraphed, everything is forced into the scene, there's no surprises, and when there's no surprises, you have a flat horror film. The twentieth time you see a floating red balloon, it brings a sigh, I guess we're about to see the clown again. Muschietti gives you at least ten seconds to get ready for the jump scares. The biggest sin of any horror film is forgetting the fundamental fact of fear, the rule that has never and will never change: the unknown is always scarier. Putting this much work into dressing up Skarsgrd undermines all of the hidden darkness the story needs. Ultimately, despite its certificate rating and fresh coat of CGI paint, this rebirth of It is as tiresome as the malevolent creature itself. I wish they'd just go away for good because they're not scary, they're boring. https://reelrunner.wordpress.com/2019/09/21/it-2017-review-uninspired-and-disappointingly-safe/"
SRB_Doc7_IT,SRB,Horror,Negative,IT,"This movie is not nearly as good as the original mini-series. It doesn't even come close to ""Stand by me"" or ""Stranger things"". A movie and a series this crap has been compared to. Which is an insult to to the movie and the series. As this is not even in the same ballpark. This version of IT is not scary at all. And the movie is filled with so many plot holes it will give you a headache, just thinking about them. SPOIILERS AHEAD!! First of all, the original first episode of ""It"" was far superior on every level. Tim Curry was far more scary as Pennywise than Bill Skarsgrd. Skarsgrd does his best but his performance is ruined by over the top CGI effects every time he appears. Maybe he simply wasn't scary enough and they thought they could improve it with special effects. The glowing eyes for one, was just dumb and infuriated me. This Pennywise is apparently much more a shapeshifter here than he was in the original. Because each kid is afraid of something different and instead of letting Pennywise scare them, he looks like the things that scare the kids. And that don't work.As for the kids themselves, they're not bad, but not very good either. Me and my friend were bored at the cinema, and made fun of the kids during several scenes where we were suppose to feel bad for them. They just seem like kid actors playing their parts. Unlike the kids in Stand by me or Stranger things, that ARE their characters, the kids here are just kids acting, nothing more. The same goes for the bullies that are way over the top as far as bullies go. As far as the horror goes, it's predictable and have way too much gore just for the sake of gore. I don't mind blood at all, but when it comes to a Stephen King movie, I expect psychological horror, mixed with a little gore. What we get here, however, is cheap jumpscares mixed with gore while showing each kids fear, one at a time and it gets boring after awhile. Cheap jumpscares is what I would expect in crap like The Comnjuring movies. Not in a so called horror movie based on a Stephen King book. In another gory and boring, but suppose to be scary scene, the ginger girls bathroom is flooded with blood coming from the drain in the sink. Her father (get to him later) comes in, because of her screams. He cant see the blood, which means its not there, but made by Penywise to scare her. Yet later on all the kids see their shared imagination of the blood soaked bathroom and starts to clean it. If the blood is not really there, then why clean the bathroom?? And if each kid has a different fear and blood is only the ginger girls fear, then the other kids shouldn't be able to see the blood. This makes no sense what so ever. The fat kid writes a poem for the ginger girl, but knowing he wrote it and saves her life, by kissing her, after the final battle with Pennywise, she still chooses another boy as her boyfriend, which makes no sense and makes her an ungrateful little bitch. *MORE SPOILERS AHEAD* But Pennywise is nt the only monster here. Evidently some of the parents are monsters too. As in evil. And get this: two of the kids kill their dads, one, the main bully, who is later on killed by one of the kids were suppose to care about and the other one, the ginger girl (who is way too sexualized to make her character believable) goes to live with her aunt in another state. She killed her own father and doesn't end up in an institution or in prison. Yeah right!! Even though her father was a scumbag that molested her, this doesn't justify murder. And with no witnesses to the father molesting her, there is no proof, so she should be in jail. And of course they're lining up a sequel as this movie is called chapter one. I for one will not see the sequel. Nor will I see this movie again. Everything here just made miss the first episode of the mini-series where the kids were great and believable and Tim Curry was truly scary as Pennywise. If you enjoy a good Stephen King movie adaptation, this is not for you. If you want something scary with really good acting from everybody, watch Stranger Things. It is amazing and everything, this movie isn't."
SRB_Doc8_IT,SRB,Horror,Negative,IT,"I hated this movie. I can't be arsed to go into too much detail. I'll just give my general impressions. This movie was marketed as having been adapted from Stephen King's modern classic ""It."" It was about seven children who come together one summer to overcome both their unique personal challenges, and a supernatural monster in their town that feeds on kids every 27 years. It's a brilliant story, a passionate giant of a book. This movie reduces it into a typical, clich-ridden, unintelligent, and very bland horror film. Taken on its own, and without any expectations, it is a fairly decent throwaway popcorn-flick to entertain teenagers. The photography is good. The writing is extremely superficial but still has a thin arc. The special effects are okay. And the jump-scares are amusing for some people. Taken as an adaptation of the novel, it's an abomination. There is so little character development that by the end of the movie, you can barely tell one character from another. You don't care about any of them because you don't get to know them. They are all contrived cardboard cutouts, and this very much includes the villain ""Pennywise"" who looks ridiculous, and is reduced to a one-dimensional boogeyman whose existence and motivation is never explained. The jump scares never end. What the film calls ""horror"" is an extremely cheap bunch of sound-blasts along with startling close-ups of the handful of mediocre monsters. The general feel of this movie was one that was written and directed by people who had no idea what the original story they'd adapted this from was about; they just cherry-picked a handful of superficial details (a very few of which I must admit they did right -- the Leper and Butch Bowers' murder) and then added in a bunch of their own ideas which were just weird and stupid (a pharmacist propositioning Beverly? Pennywise beat to death with metal pipes???). There is a very strange phenomenon going on where people seem to love this movie. I don't fully understand this except that these people don't understand what makes good cinema, and resent anyone who tries to make them aware of this. it's weird, isn't it? it reminds me of feminism, this pig-headed denial of reality. I hazard a guess that it's some weird manifestation of people in America's discontent with a republican presidency. (edit) never before in my life have I encountered a phenomenon like the almost rabid popular defense of terrible movies like ""It 2017"" or ""Ghostbusters 2016."" Having a profound love of good art, I have had countless arguments with people who think I am wrong in hating these films. All of these arguments have ended in them hurling insults like petulant toddlers in a pram because their love for these rotting placental afterbirths are purely emotional. What is going on? Basically, this generation is not just getting more stupid, which is made apparent by their incapacity to recognize banal-assed filmmaking when they see it. they are also possessed of a certain narcissistic constellation of attitudes towards life that border on sociopathic. Their basic paradigm is that there is no right or wrong, and anyone who tries to force them to follow any rules at all is a bad person. Like closet Nazis, they cling to anything that promotes these sick values with a hysterical fervor. Some more, some less. That's why some people say they love these movies. Not because they are good movies, but because they promote a certain worldview of cynical selfishness and a disregard for truth and beauty. It's Leftist propaganda."
SRB_Doc9_IT,SRB,Horror,Negative,IT,"I remember all the hype and media coverage surrounding this movie four years ago, and I honestly can't see why. That said, let's dive into the plot... So on one rainy day, Bill, who I will get into later, is pretending to be sick in bed, while making his little brother, Georgie, a paper boat. Then, still keeping the lie going, he sends Georgie on his own, where he could potentially run into danger. And of course, he does. From within a storm drain, when trying to get his boat back, It, the eponymous creature, bites his arm off and drags him into his doom. Yes, a 7 year old kid gets his arm torn off by a monster, but to quote Jurassic World (which is way better than this heap of garbage, in spite of its own shortcomings), ""monster"" is a relative term. To a canary, a cat is a monster. We're just used to being the cat. This means that It is only a monster because that's what we look at it as. Then later that summer, we meet Mike, a black kid whose parents died in a crack den fire, now forced to kill sheep for his grandfather, one assumes to make him desensitized to killing living creatures so he can kill It in the future. As school lets out, we also meet Bill's freinds, Richie, Eddie, and Stan, as well as Beverly, a girl who is hated throughout the entire school because she kissed Bill in a school play once, and Ben, a fat kid who harbours a crush on her largely because they're in the same class. But in the meantime, It is on the hunt. And even though they're just 8-12 year old kids and it's summer, you know, when they should be having fun, Bill, who is convinced Georgie somehow survived having his arm torn off by It (granted, he didn't witness the kill for himself), but as an earlier scene shows, even Bill's dad (who presumably also didn't see It tear Georgie's arm off) knows full-well Georgie is dead, decides to go off and kill the creature. Of course, none of it goes according to plan, perhaps because there wasn't one; Ben gets clawed, while Eddie gets his arm broken. And as a result, Bill gets into a quarrel with Richie over his dead brother, and alienates his ""friends"" for a week. And during this period, It finds Beverly, who has just killed (or at least knocked out) her dad, who is implied to sexually abuse her because she looks a lot like her mom who killed herself, and abducts her, so only now does Bill get his ""friends"" back together. They make a climb down into the sewers, and they reach a a cavernous room wherein It has built its nest, to save Beverly -- rendered unconscious in by It. They find her, but she won't wake up, so Ben has to kiss her. Without her consent. Look, I know, it's supposed to be romantic and fairy tale-esque, but it just comes off as creepy and forced. Once Beverly is woken up, It attacks the group and grabs ahold of Bill, while Richie explains to Bill why he dislikes him, because he's done nothing but put their lives on the line this whole summer. During this scene, I actually thought they were going to leave Bill behind to become It munchies, but out of nowhere, Richie instantly forgives Bill like it was nothing, and they do battle with It, hitting the creature with random objects they found lying around its nest, then it escapes by crawling into a hole. Not long afterward, they make a promise to return if It does and part ways. The end. I don't get why people like this, it's not an ""amazing movie,"" it's terrible, it's juvenile, Bill, the ""hero,"" is basically Donald Trump as an 8-12 year old kid, as he has the position of the ""leader,"" despite that he does a poor job of leading his party, he lies (a lot), he whines and complains like a petulant toddler, add to all that, he doesn't care about anyone but himself, and not to mention all those F-bombs (which are perhaps the true reason behind its R rating; It's otherwise relatively tame). From one interview with the Muschiettis, the two to blame for this abomination of a movie, they insisted that if they aimed for a PG-13 movie, they would've had nothing at the end, but that's not true. If Jurassic World could do a lot with a PG-13 rating, so could this, but the Muschiettis didn't want to, even though their moral compasses told them they should've. Thank you for reading my review. But wait there's more! This movie had a sequel, or second half, rather..."

SSU_Doc1_Interstellar,SSU,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar,"I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.

And this is IT!

When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.

First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.

The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are.

These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).

Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.

And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet).

Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.

Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly ""X"", will managed to convince you about that.

My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.

This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought."
SSU_Doc2_Interstellar,SSU,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar,"This year is not very good for the sci-fi cinematography. Besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre (like X-Men: Days of Future Past), there was actually only one big-budget movie worth watching: On the Edge of Tomorrow. It seems like Tom Cruise is one of the few Hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles. His recent achievements leave little to desire: Valkyrie, or Knight and Day are good at worst, with the high pitch of Oblivion. Are we able to say the same about Matthew McConaughey?

Unfortunately, not. Although his recent movies are above average (True Detective or Dallas Buyers Club), the latest picture he plays in, Interstellar (directed by Christopher Nolan and written by him and his brother), is a huge letdown and misunderstanding. I don't think anyone being fond of ""hard"" science-fiction stories will like it. Here is why.

Firstly, the story. It is in general similar to Mission to Mars or The Red Planet, where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission, which result will impact the whole human race. Unfortunately, which is the usual problem in this case, the whole plot is neither engaging, nor entertaining. We have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space. Maybe because of the long time span of the picture, the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters. Besides, the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children (which is also a time-consuming thread here). Anyway, the main conclusion of Interstellar is the banal statement that ""love is the most important thing in the world"". Do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this?

By coincidence, the second problem is the length of the movie. Currently, when the the picture is recorded not on the tape, but in the digital medium, every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible. Maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might, skills or wisdom? I have no idea, but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours, having the plot for only half of this time. This is exactly the case with Interstellar. The presented story is far from complex, and could easily fit in two hours. In fact, the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences...

This film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3...

The number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy...

The Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word ""magic"" (interchangeable with ""nonsense"") comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here...

The music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him.

Unfortunately, it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult. People like to go to the movies and see a good story. There are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie: the mystery, the convincing scenery, the real characters we could care about, finally, the emotional strain, often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to. Interstellar does not offer anything of these. It is a long and boring sermon about the future of Mankind in the universe, pretending to be the science-fiction movie. With this picture Christopher Nolan proved his only memorable work was Prestige and the Batman trilogy was not the accident, but the clear sign that his main achievements in Hollywood will be too long, boring and utterly disappointing pictures, initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema, but leaving in a complete, sad disillusion after all."
SSU_Doc3_Interstellar,SSU,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar,"The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.

You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar.

Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded.

I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.

Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push ! """
SSU_Doc4_Interstellar,SSU,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar,"This is without exception one of the dumbest films I have ever sat through. Or perhaps it's a masterpiece and I'm too dumb to understand it? Anyway .....

Here are some of the things (the list is not exhaustive) that I could not get my head around.

There is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world. And the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says, 'Oh well. Dem's the breaks' and does nothing. Seriously? Apart from that one dude in the 'super secret' NASA compound? Okay then.

A super intelligent, super advanced alien civilization has been watching us. They see that the planet is in peril. That more than six thousand million people will die from starvation. So they offer a solution. Not by curing the blight mind. No, that would be far too easy.

They construct a wormhole (they being five dimensional creatures 'n' all) close to Saturn ('cos Kubrick had already used Jupiter in 2001). The film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight (cornmash beer anybody) but it's only a matter of time before that too succumbs. So It's a matter of great urgency that the astro-heroes get to the ol' wormhole as quickly as possible.

So the far side of the Moon would be a handy place to put it.

No, no, noooo.

They place the wormhole beside Saturn. So distant from Earth that it takes two years just to fly there.

And all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called Dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at Pharming College. Anybody for cornflakes?

Now NASA have already explored the wormhole. They know that it opens into another galaxy, beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds. Because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole, time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on Earth. While back on ol' Planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace. So this was the plan?

By the super intelligent aliens? Is someone taking the p*ss? There were no planets anywhere that were ... um ... NOT right beside a black hole? Super intelligent? Doh!

And so finally, after a number of silly subplots, our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole (My God! It's full of stars?). And experiences time as a physical construct. But is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? Hell no. He is shown his daughter's bedroom on the day that he left on his 'weekend getaway.' We see him getting really upset that his daughter isn't picking up on his STAY ...... STAY! gravity assisted message, even though he should remember that she shouted STAY .... STAY! to him on that day, and he left anyway. Sheesh!

And Zimmer's soundtrack? I hadn't heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email, without him ever seeing the movie. Explains a lot really. Presumably the email went something like 'If you produce anything orchestral like Kubrick, you're off the project.' So the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven (in the cinema where I watched it) piercingly loud quasi classical discordance. Bear in mind that Kubrick chose the pieces by Strauss, etc., to assist him in editing the movie,and then realised that they actually fit perfectly, and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned.

Not Nolan.

NoSirreeBob! Email it in, Hans.

Who listens to the music anyway? Deeply, deeply disappointing.

And I loved Inception!"
SSU_Doc5_Interstellar,SSU,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar,"(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)

There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.

Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.

Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.

This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar."
SSU_Doc6_Interstellar,SSU,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar,"I liked Inception a lot and was expecting something similar from Nolan brothers, but Interstellar turned out to be massively disappointing. It's too long, too boring, too sloppy and too hard to believe what all fuss is about.

Earth is overpopulated and plants are dying from drought, dust is everywhere and starting to be a problem. This is all what we were told by a movie, everything that we should know (they think). So instead of trying to solve these problems by inventing new food forms, by ocean water demineralization or just soft decreasing of population to numbers Earth can sustain best minds came up with ingenious plan - go through suddenly discovered wormhole and see what happens. Instead of sending drones they sent bunch of people through to a no-return mission, three having reported of habitable planet each.

It is when things started to become interesting. NASA picks up some random guy pilot (McConaughey) to lead mission to these three planets, all of them coincidentally in the same system, orbiting a black hole. COME ON, three planets orbiting a black hole? If you want to live here, you might be insane. However, in a retarded fashion he decides to leave his young daughter on dying earth to pursue his all-life-mission. Some more absurd plot decision happens when he then decide to land planet with such twisted space-time (because it is near blackhole, remember - we are watching movie pretending to make sense scientifically) that it has time accelerated 60000 times comparing to earth.

Nothing very interesting happens next, three non-essential persons just die, Matt Damon being one of them by going nuts for absolutely no reason. In the end McConaughey diving into a black hole (finally making sense sequence) leaving only one woman in a mission (Hathaway) to land a planet she wanted first were her supposed lover landed previously. And while soundtrack plays loudly to draw attention from following absurd plot twist, main hero spends 60 years in another dimension translating quantum equations to his daughter on Earth which will solve all problems and allow six billions people to escape. By the way all these years everyone was just waiting, absolutely no one bothered to send more expeditions so busy they were all solving Einstein equations.

Why so silly? With so many numerous big and small plot holes this can't be serious movie. Main hero acting like a retard (or actually he is), his daughter soon-big-girl solving biggest scientific problem in history, two absolutely useless crew members with funny robot as a company and a woman supposed to be main-hero's girlfriend, a lier as main scientist and a bunch of another useless people. Even CGI can not save the day. We were told that black hole CGI supposed to be most realistic than ever, but it was pictured in roughly 1.5 scenes at best. Soundtrack is fine, but it is played so loudly, in disharmony with deep space atmosphere and in some scenes being unnecessary as well.

So what we have in the end? It just looked like they tried to make big, really BIG move about space travel and physic phenomenons, but somehow missed big picture and not really payed attention to the details, ignoring common sense which eventually led to a failure. Sadly, good opportunity to create such movie in the uncharted territory was wasted."
SSU_Doc7_Interstellar,SSU,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar,"Love is the one thing that transcends time and space...

New creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured.

I was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness.

Starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of ""Endurance"" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself.

The emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in ""Interstellar"" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere.

The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the ""Space Odyssey"" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar.

Hans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: ""Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children"", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself.

Visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The ""Endurance"" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's ""Odyssey"", and they are pleasing to the eye.

Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life.

""Interstellar"" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again.

""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light."""
SSU_Doc8_Interstellar,SSU,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar,"A good friend of mine, the writer Mark Shulman, once pointed out that our standards are being gradually eroded, so that sadly, we are left with less and less in lieu of a threshold of acceptability, finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow, imperceptible boil.

Christopher Nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that Interstellar is a love story. I will take them at their word and assume that whatever else I picked up on was left there unwittingly, for the rest of us to parse through.

Considering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a Saturday night, I feel like it's my prerogative, when I have paid good money, to take a film apart if I am still hungry for substance at the end of it; and I WILL get my nourishment from something or other, if not from the movie's plot itself.

The first thing that strikes me, when I think back to the experience of Interstellar, is that it leaves me with nothing, emotionally - no takeaway. I did not care about any of its characters, or believe they were real, and I did not really worry about the fate of humanity (any more than the film itself actually does, beyond paying it casual lip-service).

I wasn't awed like I may have been by other wondrous space movies that Interstellar measures itself against (or steals from), and I am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again. (I suspect most viewers won't either, once the collective neophile contact high has passed.)

For starters, I do not like the moral core of the story: Interstellar is a film about ""saving humanity"" but it is unclear who will pay for humanity's failures. The film offers a great debate over where to repopulate, but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place. There is no therapy, no penance, no sacrifice. In a way, this represents a subconscious confession about our culture's moral failures: when we run out of spaces to consume, and out of fertile ground to slash an burn, we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into, since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have...

But enough psychobabble. A dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about Interstellar.

The worst thing about the film is that, to quote my girlfriend, ""It's OK to for characters to talk in pseudo-scientific gobbledygook when the show is Star Trek, because in Star Trek, they all have pointy ears.""

Interstellar may be worth a glance, certainly for the photography and exciting visuals, but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions. Clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters, but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial self-sufficiency amid the vast nothingness.

The result is an often far-fetched and unintelligible, outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewer's disbelief (and cringing), to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so.

In hindsight, it makes perfect sense that Nolan's 'tightest' film is Memento, a dis-cognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together, or to remember where he started.

Interstellar is not an intelligent picture, but a pseudo-intelligent one. It seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots - a sort of space odyssey version of ""who wants to be a millionaire?"" Its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior. To whom? No one knows. This technique seems to be trending within the Nolan's filmography.

For the rest, the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale, (black hole, wormhole, same difference,) and is often plagued by ridiculous star-studded cameos that shatter the viewer's concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup.

The film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits, and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite, contrived exposition, filled with emetic pseudo physics, sure to give an immature modern audience raised on Batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce. Worst of all, it feels long and never ending.

Sadly, good science fiction is hard to come by, harder than a good ordinary film even, and although this picture is somewhat entertaining, it fades away from the heart and mind, like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed, as we head home from the cinema, once more."
SSU_Doc9_Interstellar,SSU,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar,"So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take:

To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good.

Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.

For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time.

Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop.

One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released.

After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown.

Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us."
SSU_Doc10_Interstellar,SSU,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar,"I am wondering if the people who write ""intertstellar"" 10-star reviews are actually sane, or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is sci-fi. Basically if the sic-fi component - most of which does not really happen until the end - is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic Hollywood soap opera. The worn-out rag of clich family relations, all- American-dad, ""complicated"" love affair, unruly and a classic tomboy-girl, co-workers (more like co-idiots) who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally, you know, to ""up the ante""... it really makes up 90% of this movie. Up until half- way trough I honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director. There are also very obvious holes in the plot, and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sic-fi movies at least try to amend somehow.

I can not help but think that after watching Automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards, this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump. It is literally that bad. What saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending. So just watch that instead, because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of Santa Barbara.

Spolers about ridiculous plot holes (as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough): 1) The stupid Dust Bowl recycled. Seriously? I am not even going to try to explain this because I'd need to re-post have of Wikipedia here, but it does not work that way. Not in the past - not in the future. 2) The moment NASA abducts the main character and daughter and questions them. Seriously? Maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3) NASA's facility is top secret! Right... in the age supposedly after the present, when there are drones and google maps, they manage to hide a huge facility in some old James Bond villain fashion. 4) ""LET'S GO TO ANOTHER GALAXY!"". OK if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket, carrying a futuristic ""shuttle"", WHY for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there - instead of looking in our own? What, they really expected to have better luck there - than in our own? They already searched the entire Milky Way? And what's even better - it ""just so happens"" there is a planet like a stone's throw away from the black hole and is NOT being consumed by it, and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything BUT a collapsed star? Why... let's just start diving down toilets, because you know, they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions! Like dimensions of dementia perhaps! 5) Saving the best for last - I did like the ending. Despite its absurdity I did like it. Almost cried - if I were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology, but I digress. The ""machine"" that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future- past, is built by... the very humanity he is trying to save, that survived, and built the machine in the future. Lord have mercy, I will try to explain this... So basically if we consider all major theories about time travel, in order to change the future one must go there and change it, right? But here the future changes the past, and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed future's help. Mind >>> blown!"
PKE_Doc1_OnceUponATimeInHollywood,PKE,Comedy,Negative,Once upon a time in Hollywood,"Quentin Tarantino, inarguably one of his generations most influential and inventive filmmakers, has been saying for years that he only wants to make ten films in total. Unsurprisingly, the news has sparked many discussions  the director is only 56, after all  and critics and fans alike have since speculated about what his last films might be. Would he return to Kill Bill one last time? Maybe try something completely different? It was all besides the point, of course, because his next project would generate frenzied press regardless.

Add in Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt to the mix, and youve got an obvious hit. The problem with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Tarantinos ninth film (and his penultimate, if all goes according to plan), is that it isnt worth the hype. Sure, the actors dazzle and showy camerawork abounds. History is giddily sent up. Lots of blood is spilled. But when it comes down to it, the film plays it shockingly safe, relying on the charms of A-list talent and tongue-in-cheek plot developments that diffuse necessary tension and lead to one-too-many dead ends.

At 165 minutes and with liberal editing that weaves in and out of several narrative threads, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is certainly audacious at face value. Its a strange film too, and its already generated more conversation that the rest of this summers fare combined. The problem is that it relies on DiCaprio and Pitt  and Al Pacino, Margot Robbie and a litany of young stars with famous parents  to carry the load of its oftentimes baffling storyline. Theres not much of a risk when youve got three of the most bankable stars in the world, plus one of cinemas greatest talents, to fall back on. Without these names and Tarantinos acclaim, a more truly inventive film might have been able to shine through. Instead, its a self-conscious parade of stardom and nostalgia-bating historical accuracies that cannily generates discussion without actually having hardly anything interesting to say.
Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth, Leonardo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton, and Al Pacino as Marvin Schwarzs ( Sony Pictures Entertainment / IMDB)


Once Upon a Timein Hollywood follows Rick Dalton (DiCaprio), an actor in his late 30s who fears that his career is winding down. His buddy and stunt double is Cliff Booth (Pitt), an enigmatic and violence-prone beefcake who cares for little else in the world than his friend and his dog, Brandy. Daltons existential crisis is first set off when the agent Marvin Schwarz (a miscast Pacino) tells him that his streak of playing villains will only continue to pigeonhole him moving forward. Instead, Schwarz says, he should move to Rome and boost his name with a few Spaghetti Westerns. And so he does.

On the other end are Daltons neighbors, who happen to be Roman Polanski (Rafa? Zawierucha) and Sharon Tate (Robbie). Whereas Dalton and Booths storyline is full of drama and exposition, Polanski and Tates is quiet and largely symbolic, meant to conjure the specter of the Manson Murders more than actually complicate the narrative.

The plots organizing principle is four dates  February 8 and 9, 1969, and August 8 and 9, 1969  the latter the dates of the Manson Murders. Naturally, history is an important element to the film with Tates murder always on the horizon, but the film subverts those expectations in more ways than one. The result is a highly discursive collage of Western sensibilities that comes together into a funny and occasionally charming but disappointingly bland project.

That Tarantino would mess with viewers is a given; that he would muddle American history with a bloated lineup of stars and tricks is the real surprise. Beneath all of the noise, one simply wishes for a good story. Once Upon a Time in Hollywoodis only intermittently successful on that front.

None of this is to say that the film is entirely free of charm. DiCaprio and Pitt turn in expectedly excellent performances, the former as an insecure drunk and the latter as a cool, macho sidekick who knows how to get the job done. And though the film is overlong, there are a couple of scenes that stand above and beyond the rest.

The first involves a Manson girl called Pussycat (a standout Margaret Qualley) who baits Booth into giving her a ride to the Spahn Ranch  famously the residence of the Manson cult. Upon arrival, Booth meets an endless stream of young hippie girls played by some of Hollywoods most famous offspring, including Qualley, Lena Dunham and Maya Hawke. Its a funny scene but also an arresting one, as Booth muscles his way into the main house to chat with George Spahn (Bruce Dern) and faces the suspicions of the hippies. Its also one of the films few scenes that manage to be both meta and satisfying in its own right.
Another standout scene involves Dalton in one of his first Italian film roles. Before shooting a pivotal scene, he runs into a precocious eight-year-old actress (Julia Butters, the films real MVP) who takes her duties seriously and challenges him to do the same. Later, as the pair share a scene together, Dalton finally lives up to his latent acting talent, and DiCaprio gives a seething, maniacal monologue made for an Oscar reel. After the scene, the young actress whispers to him, That was the best acting Ive ever seen in my life, and he tears up. Its far and away DiCaprios best moment in the film, and its easily the films most sincere moment.

The problem with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood isnt that theres no fun to be had; its that the truly charming moments  besides the obvious totems like Pitt taking his shirt off or Robbie clad in chic 60s outfits  are too few and far between and, ultimately, come together in a disappointing and somewhat baffling final. Its alarming to consider that Robbie actually had fewer lines in a previous edit considering how light her role is here, and how baiting it is to use the Manson Murders as a touchstone without adding anything new to the well-worn narrative.
Like many of Tarantinos best works (notably Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction), Once Upon a Time in Hollywoodsplices together errant narrative threads to form a larger picture. But where those films succeed by tying everything together in the third act, the directors latest effort falls back on senseless, gruesome violence, and an inexplicable act of revisionism to gather loose threads. Not only is this one of Tarantinos least risky films, its also one of his most forgettable. With just one film left to his name, lets hope hes got more tricks up his sleeve  some that will make for great cinema, not just good discussion.
"
PKE_Doc2_OnceUponATimeInHollywood,PKE,Comedy,Positive,Once upon a time in Hollywood,"Even in a summer dominated by Disney, the 9th film from Quentin Tarantino demands attention. The promise of the Pulp Fiction directors take on The Manson Family has resulted in the biggest opening weekend ever for a Tarantino film, giving a small flicker of hope to anyone who sees a cinematic future beyond remakes and superheroes. 

The film is set in an alternative Hollywood in 1969, around the time that Charles Manson and his Family would begin their infamous crime spree. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Rick Dalton, an alcoholic, insecure actor who was the star of a successful 50s cowboy show, but now finds his career faltering. He coasts on guest spots, driven around by his loyal stuntman/assistant Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). A new job and a series of coincidences sees both mens fates intertwined with that of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), a young movie star in the headlines for her relationship with Roman Polanski. 

Tarantino has insisted he will retire from the big screen after ten films, potentially making this his penultimate work. Hes always divided opinion, but those who are fans of his grindhouse symphonies will be in heaven here. He brings to life a Hollywood thats in flux, with the remnants of the old studio system slowly crumbling and the talent struggling to keep up with the times. 

Ive heard the movie referred to as Tarantinos Seinfeld  in other words a movie about nothing. And thats true to some extent  there isnt an overarching plot  but thats not to say nothing happens. Like many Tarantino films, its really about spending time with the characters. The camera patiently observes as we are led into the Hollywood of Steve McQueen, Polanski, and Bruce Lee. The martial arts legend is portrayed in a rather unflattering light, although actor Mike Mohs impression is strikingly accurate. By contrast, Damian Lewis doesnt quite capture the essence of McQueen, although the appearance is a short one. There are also famous faces in smaller roles, such as Al Pacino as a talent agent; Kurt Russell as a henpecked stuntman; and Luke Perry in his final appearance as one of Daltons co-stars. 
At the centre of it all is DiCaprio, proving himself to be one of the most versatile actors around. Last time he worked with the director he played vile slave owner Calvin Candie. Dalton is a different proposition altogether. Bloated and fragile, his lifetime of vices has resulted in persistent coughs and grunts; its a portrait of a man at the bottom of the showbiz barrel. And while the role could have been played for laughs, DiCaprio brings nuance and pathos. 

Parallel to this is the story of Tate, played brilliantly by Robbie. Headlines were written about the fact the Suicide Squad actor doesnt have many lines, but a lack of dialogue doesnt mean a lack of importance (just ask the cast of last years A Quiet Place). Told visually, Robbies Tate provides a graceful juxtaposition to Dalton, showing a career just taking off rather than one winding down. She wanders wide-eyed into a cinema to watch herself in comedy The Wrecking Crew, barely containing her glee at the audiences responses. The innocence of the way shes portrayed is given a weight by the knowledge of whats to come. 

Pitt is the connective tissue, becoming embroiled in a tense confrontation with the Manson Family that will ultimately link Dalton and Tates fates in an ultra-violent finale. The veteran plays Cliff like an urban cowboy, tearing through the freeways when not required by his boss, getting into trouble and punching his way out of it. 

The fourth star of the film only has one scene, but is a presence felt throughout. Charles Manson is an uneasy reminder that all these interweaving journeys will lead to something terrible. Just as you settle into the comedy, one of his clan  including Margaret Qualley as the precocious Pussycat, Lena Dunham as the creepily maternal Catherine Share, and Austin Butler as the sinister Tex  pops up to let you know things may not end well. 
Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is Tarantinos love letter to the town he grew up in, and the shady characters that formed its population. Gloriously grimy, its a masterpiece of nostalgia, allowing his audience to inhabit a world of low-lives and cults. A 161 minute, adult-focused summer film is as rare as hens teeth in modern Hollywood, and as the filmmakers career reaches its final chapters, we may eventually look at this as one of the last examples of a risky, big budget movie. For now, lets enjoy the stylish bedlam; make sure you stick around for the in-joke riddled credits."
PKE_Doc3_OnceUponATimeInHollywood,PKE,Comedy,Positive,Once upon a time in Hollywood,"Once Upon a Time  in Hollywood is a nostalgic romp, set over the course of a few days in 1969 Los Angeles. Its a fictionalized story about fictional characters in the entertainment industry existing adjacent to real-life actors and events who are also depicted in the film. Incidentally, 1969 was also a time in Hollywood of the Manson Family murders.

1969 is essentially a pivotal year for the once prominent western TV actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio). Ricks show was canceled, and his hopes of a meteoric movie career have dried up. Now, the best Dalton can achieve is one-off guest spots as the villain on other television programs and pilots. Or, he can take up the offer of a persuasive Hollywood dealmaker, Marvin Schwarzs (Pacino), to go to Italy and make Spaghetti westerns, which Dalton considers a disgrace and the potential death knell of his career.

Living next door to Dalton is none other than superstar director Roman Polanski (Zawierucha) and his young, rising starlet wife, Sharon Tate (Robbie). The scenes of Dalton mulling over his declining career are juxtaposed with sequences of Polanski and Tate enjoying their surging stardom, attending opulent parties at the Playboy Mansion and interacting socially with some of the brightest stars in town, such as Steve McQueen (Lewis). Daltons biggest projects were mid-level successes at best. Daltons best days in the biz are behind him, while Tate is on the verge of becoming a bonafide global movie star.
One of the best qualities of Tarantinos Once Upon a Time  in Hollywood is his vivid creation of a living, breathing, romantic, oddly idyllic version of Los Angeles in the late 60s. The screening for the film was projected in 35mm, which improved the authenticity and immersion of the cinematic experience. This is quite possibly the most immersive film of Tarantinos career. Its a transportation to a Hollywood of yesteryear, fictionalized or not. Good films should truly engross the audience and transport viewers to that world displayed onscreen. Once Upon a Time  in Hollywood easily fits that mold.

Rather than spotlighting the Manson Family and their surroundings, Tarantino mainly focuses on Dalton and his relationship with his buddy, handyman, driver and sometimes-stuntman Cliff Booth (Pitt). Cliff Booth bears a closer resemblance to the type of men Dalton and his contemporaries always tried to emulate in their era. Despite a somewhat suspect background, Cliff appears to be a very pragmatic and reliable person. Cliff makes sure Dalton makes his call times despite the declining TV stars heavy drinking. Its an amusing bromance.
DiCaprio and Pitt deliver strong, convincing performances in their respective roles of Dalton and Booth. Their relationship is very believable. The characters blend well into the period. At 55 years old, Pitts physique will give men half of his age and Tom Cruise a run for their money. Dalton and Booth are both flawed individuals, but they both possess a rugged charm and likability. For Dalton, it comes through in his vulnerability. Some of the damage Dalton is dealt is self-inflicted, but he tries and struggles so hard that he comes off as an underdog.
The film raises the question of why someone like Cliff Booth even puts up with the likes of Rick Dalton. The obvious implication is that Cliff Booth has lived the life that Hollywood movie stars attempt to play onscreen, and Booth can do all the things that they merely pretend to do on the big screen. Movie stars are pretenders. Actors play make-believe, while Booth is more than likely the genuine article. The answer is a bit murky, but there is a sense that Dalton genuinely respects Booth and tries to help him continue working when Booth has become blacklisted in the industry over rumors and gossip.

Once Upon a Time  in Hollywood is certainly well made. Along with the immersive, nostalgic snapshot of 1969 LA, Tarantino has always been very good at putting his stamp on his productions. There are so few directors at this point that have a trademark style. Once Upon a Time  in Hollywood certainly maintains Tarantinos unique flair.

One particular drawback is the films whopping 161-minute runtime. There is nothing wrong with a long movie. However, there is one overwrought flashback sequence that contains a flashback within a flashback. Whenever that happens, no matter the film or the filmmaker, its a bit much. At the very least, its not a character remembering something they were not privy to or were not even there for, but the movie is still on the long side. Tarantino favors longer takes, and he lets scenes breathe. Sometimes thats fine. Other times, some scenes come off as rather perfunctory.
Tarantino dialogue can also be an acquired taste. His dialogue tends to have a unique interplay and cadence. There is banter here that comes off as misplaced and out-of-sync with the period setting. One scene of dialogue, in particular, sounds like Tarantino is having a go at his own staunchest critics. In addition, multiple characters appear for one scene with only sparse lines of dialogue, and then they are gone. That seems like a waste in the case of certain performers.
The presence of the Manson Family, Charles Manson (Herriman) and other people involved with one of Hollywoods darkest tragedies are slightly misleading. Tarantino acknowledges and pays slight homage to the people and history of those surrounding events. However, Once Upon a Time  in Hollywood is not a story about the Manson family. Its the story of a struggling actor, and how his Hollywood dreams are on the verge of coming to an end. As the title suggests, its imbued with a sense of fairytale-like whimsy, with a dark edge, as well as some brutal depictions of violence for which Tarantino is known.

Without getting into spoilers, the film causes intense ambivalence with its treatment of certain events. Some may not even take issue with their depiction. For better or worse, Tarantino is true to his vision of a Hollywood fairytale. Quentin Tarantino's unique style is on full display for Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood. That might make it a masterpiece to some or veritable trash to others. Overall, it's a good film with superlative acting performances that's well made and creates an authentic, immersive atmosphere of an idolized, nostalgic 1969 Los Angeles. The movie runs too long even when one can appreciate Tarantino's penchant for long takes and letting scenes breathe. Mileage may vary, but this is definitely a film that movie lovers should watch at least once in the cinemas. Speaking as someone who generally disliked Death Proof and Inglorious Basterds, this was a far more enjoyable and superior experience."
PKE_Doc4_OnceUponATimeInHollywood,PKE,Comedy,Negative,Once upon a time in Hollywood,"A love letter to Hollywood, oozed one excitable British reviewer when describing Quentin Tarantinos latest work, a film about which critical gushing has been more or less relentless.

Its custom made to appeal to masculine reviewers of a certain age, and lets be honest, most film critics are male, and knocking on. Packed from end to end with throwaway film references and loving recreations of 1960s TV crime shows and westerns, it is a very conscious attempt to capture the zeitgeist of an era that was about to end. That would be classic Hollywood, the version run mercilessly by charlatan studio bosses who treated actors (and especially actresses) like cattle, lived like doges and pumped out good and bad movies like there was no tomorrow. By the late 60s, their jig was up, and Tarantinos film in one sense revolves around the notorious incident thats often cited as old Hollywoods death knell - the Manson Family murders. After that, many a hack writer has declared without apparent irony, Hollywood lost its innocence. The idea that it ever had any is hilarious: this, remember, is the prototypical gated community that brought you hushed up rapes, forced abortions, Fatty Arbuckle, Errol Flynn and poor old Lupe Velez, the silent era starlet whose attempt to create the perfect, headline-grabbing suicide ended in ignominy with her head in a toilet bowl. If that tragicomic death isnt a perfect metaphor for Hollywood I dont know what is, but Mr. Tarantino has a tear ever-hovering in the corner of his eye as he painstakingly recreates Tinseltown at the messy end of the 1960s. Assembling his usual stellar line-up, hes cast Leo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton, a TV actor whose career is on the slide. Rick was once the swaggering star of Bounty Law, a Bonanza-like western series, but its been canned and so has he, and now hes reduced to villainous, moustache-twirling bit parts. Ricks a diva, prone to operatic outbursts of self-pity, and with no woman apparently prepared to stick around and hold his hand, his loyal stuntman and driver regularly steps into the breach. Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) has worked with Rick for years: hes a happy-go-lucky soul, with a flair for martial arts and training bull terriers, and seems to have endless patience where his buddys strops are concerned. Meanwhile, even the bit parts are running out, and Rick's blandly suave agent Marvin Schwarz (a crazy-haired Al Pacino) is trying to persuade him to go to Italy and star in one of those new-fangled spaghetti westerns. The only bright spot in Daltons blighted life is the fact that a celebrity couple have moved in next door to him on Cielo Drive. Roman Polanski is the next big thing in Hollywood thanks to the success of Rosemarys Baby, and his beautiful wife Sharon Tate is pregnant with their first child. Rick watches enviously from his window as they swish off to A-list parties in Polanskis sports car. Thats how the other half live, he thinks, but the golden couple may not be as lucky as he supposes. Though Cliff takes a Hitchcockian trip to Spahn Ranch, home of the Family, and Manson makes a brief appearance loitering with intent outside the Polanski residence, he and they are peripheral to this story, which is a buddy movie, an elegy to a dying era, and an elaborate revenge fantasy which shows a grand contempt for historical fact."
PKE_Doc5_OnceUponATimeInHollywood,PKE,Comedy,Positive,Once upon a time in Hollywood,"For almost 30 years, director Quentin Tarantino has created a resume that is not only impressive but has thrown him into the discussion as one of the finest directors of this generation. Despite not hitting the mark on all his films, any time Tarantino releases a movie, there is always an aura of excitement that revolves around it. That is no different from his ninth film, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. A movie that after only two viewings has entered the conversation for me as my top tier of Tarantino films.

Once Upon A Time in Hollywood follows actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stuntman (Brad Pitt) as they attempt to adjust to the changing times of Hollywood in the 1960s. What Ive read over the past few days is that the film is pointless and nothing occurs throughout the films length until the final act, I disagree with these opinions. For me, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is the complete opposite. The film carries a ton of heart about two mens realization that the twilight of their careers is imminent and Tarantino shows differences between them but emphasizes that despite their differences, both men have the same fear  the end of the line.

The audiences interest in both Rick and Cliff stem from Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitts performances in this film. While it is already known by the masses that these two are in the top tier of their professions, their chemistry is undeniable, and both men do a sensational job of creating the perception for cinephiles that these two men are not just colleagues in the entertainment industry, but the closest confidants and friends in each others respective lives.

After winning the Academy Award for his role in The Revenant, DiCaprio is back with another performance that should not only guarantee him an Academy Award nomination but should be considered the favorite as awards season commences. DiCaprio steals every scene he is in and is both hilarious and sympathetic and can blend emotions beautifully whenever its needed. The scene that portrays these emotions very effectively is a scene with Julia Butter, an 8-year old co-star on the set of Lancer who makes time to speak with Rick about acting as more than a profession but a craft. That scene captures the essence of Leos performance as it is both hilarious and heartbreaking.

Brad Pitt should also be ready to call his tailor for a new tux at next years Academy Awards. I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a Pitt performance as much as I enjoyed his role in this film. There are moments within the film that are nothing short of brilliant. Cliffs back and forth with Bruce Lee early on in this film provide some of the biggest laughs of the film.

While Margot Robbies portrayal as Sharon Tate is minimal and plays more as a MacGuffin to Tarantinos movement of the plot, Robbies charisma is on full display. Speaking to my colleague this past weekend, we both agree that one of the most heartfelt moments in the film involves Robbie, a movie theater, and a screening. A moment in the movie that not only captures Sharon Tates desire to be a successful actress but the joy she attains by watching her film with an audience and their acceptance of her because of her performance.

When it comes down to the involvement of the Manson family in the film, Tarantino does a great job of evoking the creepiness and power Charles Manson had over his family with the minimal participation of Charles himself. As seen in this WatchMojo video (Spoiler Alert!), the use of the Manson family is fairly accurate, and credit should be given to Tarantino for creating the sense of fear that this family had over Hollywood in 1969.

Once Upon a Time In Hollywood also continues the trend of immaculately shot Tarantino films. Robert Richardson, who previously worked with Tarantino in Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained, and The Hateful Eight can make 1969 Hollywood, not just a character but a focal point of this film. Every single still frame of Richardsons shots throughout this film are tremendous and is what I consider the best cinematography of 2019 thus far.

As a fan of Tarantino for many years, I have always admired the fact that he is a director that has no issue with taking risks, and it is evident in his filmography. Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is no different as the risks he takes in the films climax are nothing short of bat-shit crazy. What makes the films climax extremely useful is the fact that despite the risks taken, the films final shot is one of the most heartbreaking shots Ill see all year.

In a world where franchises and reboots rule Hollywood, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is a breath of fresh air as it cements itself as one of the best films of 2019 and one, that is sure to be in the discussion as one for the acclaimed directors greatest achievements."
PKE_Doc6_OnceUponATimeInHollywood,PKE,Comedy,Negative,Once upon a time in Hollywood,"For the second straight time, Quentin Tarantino has made a mean, ugly movie that revels in the grotesque mutilation of a woman at the hands of a man. His defenders will claim, as the writer/director does, that his violence and cynicism is an equal-opportunity employer. Such a reading fails to place that brutality in the context of the real world, where the ratio of monstrous evils perpetrated by the sexes are decidedly not equivalent. Watching a character positioned as a likable fellawho is strongly suggested to have murdered his wife with a harpoon because she annoyed himmercilessly bludgeon two womens faces is a cinematic choice that has real-world implications.

For the second straight time, Quentin Tarantino has crafted a movie that is bloated and sluggish, ballooned to nearly twice an acceptable length for the amount of watchable content actually provided. Absent the pulsing energy that inhabited even the quietest scenes in his previous works, Once Upon a TimeIn Hollywood is often just plain-old dull.

For the first time, Quentin Tarantino has directed a movie without the N word. Instead, he opts for a few jokes at the expense of Mexicans and turns the only significant, named character who isnt white into an obnoxious braggart who deserves a good ass kicking. That obnoxious braggart would be Bruce Lee.

For the last time, Quentin Tarantinos association with a project gave hope that the final product would outweigh the films concept. A nearly washed-up actor, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), and his stuntman buddy, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), run into and around events surrounding the Mason family murders. This conceit is an excuse to let Tarantino explore spaghetti westerns, 1960s television programs and revisionist history in which the director is positioned as a hero for rewriting the past. The men are surrounded by feet with other body parts attached, or as most people call them women, who are all either virgin/mothers who must be protected at all costs or duplicitous, sometimes murderous, whores. At one point, Cliff nobly decides not to have sex with an underage girl, not because he doesnt really, really want to, but because he refuses go to jail for poontang.

For the ninth time, Quentin Tarantino builds a playlist that is either electrically eclectic or trying far too hard. These tracks fill the air in laborious, conversation-free segments of people driving. Whats missing, as in The Hateful Eight, are any quotable lines of dialogue that immediately transfer from screen to memory to tongue. Those who claim OUATIH is vintage Tarantino have a starkly different recollection of the best parts of his earlier filmography.

For the third time, Quentin Tarantino made a movie without editor Sally Menkes, who died tragically in 2010. He has not made a truly great film without her. He has made two exceptionally awful films in her absence. In interviews, he has suggested that the nature of their collaboration was one in which Menkes kept him from his worst indulgences. Without knowing exactly how their relationship functioned, all that can be said is that his output without her has been cynical and cruel without any meaningful purpose.

The next time Quentin Tarantino makes a movie, I will not be looking forward to it."
PKE_Doc7_OnceUponATimeInHollywood,PKE,Comedy,Positive,Once upon a time in Hollywood,"Quentin Tarantinos Once Upon a Time in Hollywood luxuriates in its setting of 1969 Los Angeles. His characters drive around in leisurely scenes, passing by forgotten restaurants and Hollywood Boulevard moviehouses that advertise obscure titles from yesteryear, while unremembered songs like Los Bravos Bring a Little Lovin light up the radio. The atmosphere, a cultural chasm separated by the lingering 1950s optimism and an emergent streak of hippie counter-culture, is evident in the top movies at the box-office that year. The old guard of the studio system put out The Love Bug and Paint Your Wagon, whereas independent mavericks spoke to an emboldened new audience with Easy Rider and Midnight Cowboy. The reality of the eras political strife and oppressive paranoia was easier to take given the pockets of free love, mind-expanding drugs, and harmony represented by Woodstock. At the same time, the moon landing promised that humankind could reach the expansive universe beyond our earthly realm. Its a mythical time that has, in some form or another, shaped Tarantinos life and each of his filmsthough he was just six when his ninth feature takes place, he spent much of his youth soaking up the culture of the 1960s. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantinos great gift to the audience; its a chance to see the era through his eyes, but its also his chance at historical revenge.

In her essay The White Album, Joan Didion wrote that the spirit of the 1960s ended abruptly on August 9, 1969, the day after three members of the so-called Manson Family walked up Cielo Drive to the home of Roman Polanski, who was in Europe preparing his next picture, and his eight-months-pregnant wife, Sharon Tate. The bloody and tragic result of that encounter festers in the back of the viewers mind while watching Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, filling us with a horrible sense of anticipation. But Tate, played by Margot Robbie, is a peripheral figure in the overall film, a detail that has earned Tarantino scorn in some circles. Detractors arguing against the film from the perspective of current sociopolitical concerns ignore that Tarantino has already given us incredible women such as The Bride and Jackie Brown. They fail to see why Tates role is almost purely symbolic. She enjoys watching and being in movies, listening to good music, and driving around the Hollywood hills at top speeds with her husband (Rafal Zawierucha). In a particularly charming sequence, Tate visits a cinema showing The Wrecking Crew, in which she plays the klutz whos really a trained spy, and she beams every time her performance causes a laugh from her fellow moviegoers. Tate is less central to the story than a shining product of the era and its potential. Her fate in the filma tight-lipped secret that will be discussed in the paragraphs belowis essential to its raison dtre. Not only does Tarantino allow his audience to inhabit this world, he jealously protects the era, epitomized by Tate, from an abrupt end. 
Throughout this two-hour-and-forty-minute saga, which is more of a hangout movie than the epic title implies, Tarantino saturates the viewer in the 1969 Hollywood milieu. At the top is Sharon Tate, whose husband just released Rosemarys Baby to widespread acclaim and fervor, while headed toward the bottom is Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), whose heyday as the star of a few B-movie actioners, and the hero of the Western series Bounty Law, has given way to a dwindling career of guest appearances on episodic television, usually as the villain. As a producer played by Al Pacino explains, if Rick keeps playing the heavy, the audience will begin to associate him with bad guys, and hell fall out of favor. Theres the option of going to Europe to star in Italian Westerns, but Rick wants to remain where its at, in Hollywood. Though hes not entirely washed up, Rick drinks too much and spends most of his time with his regular stunt man, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt)who also serves as a personal assistant and housesitter, and he might be Ricks only and most dependable friend. Together, they drive around Los Angeles, bullshit on the set of his latest gig, and engage in an endearing form of male camaraderie, while the viewer absorbs the details: the painted movie posters, the television shows, the predominance of single-screen theaters, the classic cars, and the excellent music (Tarantino has given us another vital soundtrack).   

Meanwhile, Rick starts to recognize his failings in the protagonist of a pulp fiction paperback hes reading. As Rick explains to his eight-year-old costar, an uncommonly composed and method child actor (Julia Butters) whom he meets on the set of his latest guest spot, the book is about a past-his-prime horsebreaker: Hes coming to terms with what its like to become slightly more useless each day. The same is true of Rick, whose frequent coughing fits and hangovers stem from the omnipresence of cigarettes and alcohol in his life, whereas his anxieties about his career have manifested in the occasional stutter and forgotten line. The state of Ricks career and the meaning it gives his life hold sway over the audience. Hes a sad figure whom we want to succeed, to the extent that when he finally delivers what his costar calls the best acting Ive ever seen, the scene becomes triumphant enough to induce tears (both Ricks and the audiences). At the same time, Tarantino creates his own behind-the-scenes lore in support of his devotion to the period, such as how he explores the subculture of stunt workers. Kurt Russell, playing a far less deranged stuntman in this QT picture, heads a crew of daredevils alongside his on-screen wife, played by real-life stuntwoman Zo Bell. And theyre none too fond of Cliff given a disturbing rumor about his past.    

While Rick is playing a cowboy on the set, the film follows Cliffs amblin around Hollywood in leather moccasins, living the takes-no-shit modern cowboy life. Tarantino has talked at length about his love of Westerns; hes made two of them, and hes evoked them in his other films countless times. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is another sort of Western, and Cliff is the lone gunman who saunters into a frontier town, makes enemies, and brings a dead reckoning in the finale. In a brilliant extended sequence, Tarantino intercuts Rick on the Western shows set with Cliffs very own trip to a dusty complex of saloons, stables, and paranoid townsfolk. When Cliff agrees to give a hitchhiking hippie (Margaret Qualley) a ride home, he discovers she lives with several other vagabonds on the Spahn Movie Ranchonce a working ranch and setpiece for movie Westerns. Now its the home of Charles Manson (Damon Herriman, mostly absent) and his brainwashed devotees, who train their pistol eyes on Cliff as he explores his former stomping grounds and insists on speaking with its blind and elderly owner (Bruce Dern). The sequence is shot with all the style, tension, and surroundings of a Western, complete with a showdown opposite Dakota Fannings unsettling Squeaky Fromme. Of course, Cliff can handle himself, as demonstrated earlier when he encounters Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) on the backlot. And afterward, one cant help but wonder if Rick realizes that his friend is a real cowboy, while he just plays one on TV. 

Unlike many of Tarantinos recent films, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not composed of several individual sequences that each gradually crescendos to a violent resolution, although an argument could be made that the entire film is one long sequence that builds to a decisive moment. The laid back quality of the film recalls his underrated Jackie Brown, where the characters and mood take precedence over the machinations of the plot. Some may find his rollicking in the period dull, but another sort of viewer will cling to every moment with the same gleeful enthusiasm as the writer-directoreven if we never experienced the setting first-hand, its energy and allure are infectious. And yet, Tates death remains in the back of our minds each time she appears onscreen, as Robbies free-and-easy presence incites a sense of dread for its eventual loss. But Tarantino uses our expectations, playing with reality and fiction to deliver a conclusion that redirects our terror. Though about two hours of the film takes place in February 1969, the final act leaps forward several months to August, just as Rick and Cliff complete their sojourn to the Italian film industry. Rick is now married and unable to keep Cliff on the payroll, and their final night together is fateful to be sure.
Once again, Tarantino has made a film that exacts historical revenge. The dish best served cold has been a persistent theme in his work, from the Brides laundry list of future victims in Kill Bill to the assorted retaliations throughout The Hateful Eight. But Tarantinos historical revenge films have rewritten history with a view toward catharsis and fictional poetic justice. His Nazi-killing band of Jewish-American soldiers in Inglourious Basterds put an end to the Third Reich when they unleashed a barrage of bullets into Hitlers face, while his former slave turned bounty hunter in Django Unchained brought ruin to a vile plantation. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood offers another brand of historical revenge in service of Tarantinos beloved era, whose death he refuses to depict. The film is a loving ode, but its also a denial of historical fact, and in that, a passionate commitment to keeping the spirit of Los Angeles in 1969 alivea spirit personified by Tate. That the Manson Family never reaches the Polanski home in the film becomes a rousing turn of events, unleashing both the full force of Cliff and Rick, thus promising, in this alternate reality of Tarantinos creation, that no such trauma will bring the era to a close.

Although watching a Tarantino film can sometimes feel like a game of spot the reference, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood does not have the pastiche quality of some of his workthough the nods are there for those looking, theyre arguably more esoteric. But his approach, as usual, is vibrant and alive. He and cinematographer Robert Richardson have filled the picture with a myriad of film styles, aspect ratios, and various uses of color and black-and-white photography. They recreate scenes from The Great Escape or television series The F.B.I. with loving attention to detail or interrupt the narrative with Kurt Russells omniscient narrator. Watching it is a joyful experience rooted in the appreciation of great, playful filmmaking and acting. DiCaprio is brilliant at capturing the profound insecurities of an actor, while Pitt offers a cucumber cool figure on the sidelines who prefers not being in the spotlight. When theyre together, the warmth of their friendship is unquestionably sincere. Outside of the terrific leading men, Tarantino has populated every scene with an ensemble of his regular players and a few new ones: Michael Madsen, Timothy Olyphant, Luke Perry, Damian Lewis, Emile Hirsch, Scoot McNairy, Lena Dunham, and plenty others.  

Tarantino immerses the viewer in Hollywood lore and everyday life, while his revisionist history functions as a testament to his adoration of the period and a fanciful rejection of what happened to Tate and her friendsand how that meant the end to this beloved era. Those committed to historical accuracy will surely feel that Tarantino has somehow betrayed reality, but then, what sane person looks for an accurate account of history in a Hollywood film anyway? Tarantinos work of historical revenge does not make arbitrary alterations; it provides a beautiful, even tender-hearted sense of defiance and fantasy. In another way, it also might be the summa of his work, as it encapsulates many of his themes and preoccupations, from foot fetishism to the mythologizing of forgotten cinema in the modern cultural consciousness. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantino at his most human and mature; much like Jackie Brown, he relies less on referential material and more on exploring rich, fully developed characters who seem to live and breathe. Surprisingly emotional and compassionate, its an elegy to a bygone era and a sheer pleasure to behold."
PKE_Doc8_OnceUponATimeInHollywood,PKE,Comedy,Negative,Once upon a time in Hollywood,"A full quarter-century after Quentin Tarantino snagged a Palme d'Or for his second feature, Pulp Fiction, the director returned to the Cannes Film Festival with his ninth, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: a reverie set in the Los Angeles of 1969, in the historical-revisionist mould of Inglourious Basterds.

It's as rich in intertextual reference and period detail as you'd expect of the fanboy-auteur  and as self-indulgent as you might fear (especially if you watched his last film, the turgid Hateful Eight).

While Tarantino may not have taken home the Palme this time around, his film was without a doubt the hottest ticket in town, with punters jostling for position in lines that began to snake down the Croisette hours in advance of the premiere.
Originally touted as Tarantino's ""Manson family movie"", Once Upon a Time is actually more of a mid-life crisis movie.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Rick Dalton, an ageing TV cowboy whose alcoholism does not pair well with his growing suspicion that he's just not destined for movie stardom after all  that he's more ""has-been"" than Steve McQueen.

His closest pal and drinking buddy is his long-time stuntman Cliff Booth (a character modelled on Hollywood daredevil Hal Needham, who frequently doubled for Burt Reynolds on screen), played by a leathery-looking Brad Pitt.
Cliff has been finding it hard to get work lately, primarily because he's known around town for killing his wife and getting away with it  a situation that both Rick and the film seem sympathetic to.

Tellingly, Cliff's wife only features in one brief flashback: she's shown lounging in a deckchair, whinging at Cliff as he stares off into space.

Both men sense that showbiz ain't what it used to be, and that there might not be major roles for them in this budding 'New Hollywood'.

It's worth pointing out that Tarantino, whose career is intertwined with that of the Weinsteins, is himself a middle-aged man working in the industry during a period of substantial change.

Perhaps Once Upon a Time can be read as speaking to some latent anxiety around remaining relevant.

On the cusp of a downward spiral, Rick is buoyed by the sight of his new neighbours: Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha), fresh from Rosemary's Baby, and his wife, the beautiful and famously ill-fated starlet Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie).

""I could be one pool party away from starring in a new Polanski movie,"" Rick drunkenly reasons.
The Mansons, meanwhile, lurk at the fringes of the narrative. They make their first appearance early on, while Cliff is driving Rick home from set: a rag-tag hippie girl gang parades past the car, clutching the fruits of a dumpster-diving expedition.

One of them (Margaret Qualley) flashes a peace sign at Cliff, and he responds in kind. Oh, the irony.

Of course the promise of violence hangs over the film (this is Tarantino we're talking about), becoming weightier as it moves towards the historical date of the Tate murders.
But Once Upon a Time is relatively light on the ultra-violence so closely associated with the director  who spends most of the generous 161-minute runtime crosscutting between his main characters as they go about their daily lives.

Rick rehearses lines with his tape player and contemplates making spaghetti westerns in Italy (career advice from an agent, played by Al Pacino).

Cliff drives around town doing odd-jobs before going home to a dingy caravan, where his pitbull eagerly awaits her dinner.

Sharon parties at the Playboy Mansion and bops along to records in her Cielo Drive home.
In short, not much really happens. (Until it does.)

Tarantino seems more interested in showing off his lead actors  who take clear delight in hamming it up for him  and his loving recreation of Los Angeles landmarks (like Musso & Frank's and El Coyote) than he is in building dramatic tension.

This wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that Rick and Cliff are unlikeable knuckleheads, and Robbie's Sharon is a free-spirited bimbo. These are not people I want to spend the day with. They're less offensive (as gendered stereotypes) than they are simply boring.

It's when members of the Manson family appear  grubby, shrewd, and menacing  that Once Upon a Time perks up, and acquires some of the mystique demanded by the subject matter.

It's enough to make you wish that Tarantino had made the Manson-centric movie he initially announced instead."
PKE_Doc9_OnceUponATimeInHollywood,PKE,Comedy,Negative,Once upon a time in Hollywood,"Can I say it yet? Are we woke enough to hear the truth? Or are readymade ironies and shallow observations now the best we can do? I ask because I dont want to hate on Quentin Tarantino as a person. I just think he makes a lot of bad movies. Yet, we embrace them because somewhere along the way, we made a collective decision its more about brand than substance.

Tarantinos brand, forged by the truly revolutionary Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, is black comedy freebasing film references  a product tailor-made for the TV-weaned boomers and X-ers who know what a Gomer Pyle is. Tarantino makes us feel special for it, too. He recreates the fabric of the pop-culture past with the passion only a film nerd can muster, and as a result, we forgive the crass rip-off of a classic, or academically validate grotesque amounts of violence.

I think we do this because hes representing what we know and recognize, which affirms our place in the infinite cosmos. Moreover, he does it in such a thrilling  cinematic way  that we get lost in the nostalgia, and machinery of it all, and forget to process what hes actually presenting amongst the fields of saturated eye candy.

I dont want to hate on Quentin Tarantino as a person. I just think he makes a lot of bad movies. Yet, we embrace them because somewhere along the way, we made a collective decision its more about brand than substance.

Once Upon a Time In Hollywood offers the perfect opportunity to probe a little deeper, because its a bad movie. Funny how I immediately want to qualify that with words of praise about how good Brat Pitt looks in a pair of sunglasses, and how well Leonardo DiCaprio can act. Because, honestly, Id prefer to step back  the same way I did in high school at the smokers entrance  and not feel the peer pressure; the social media group-think that now infects most film critics, if not everyone on the planet.

Yet, even though this isnt the most egregious of Tarantino movies, it highlights all the things he does so poorly, but gets away with because hes doing it on purpose. For starters, theres this problem with the shots matching, the angles and the coverage. In one pivotal restaurant scene in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Al Pacino and Leonardo DiCaprio are discussing a career move  but all were really noticing is how awkward each cut is, and wondering if its a meta statement on moviemaking.

Because of course it is. Its titled Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Duh.

Which means we have to look past the pointless, but nonetheless pleasing uses of the crane shot mimicking A Touch of Evil, his own camera on the back a convertible trick, the meandering plot lines that lead nowhere except a presumed reprise of Helter Skelter, and of course, the graphic, comedy-inflected violence that defines the Tarantino brand as a whole.

At least Once Upon a Time in Hollywood holds off on the gore-fest until the very end. Yet, because he frames the whole piece around the Sharon Tate murders and the massacre that made Charles Manson a household name, its a finale we approach with endless dread. And once again, like he did in Reservoir Dogs, the dread  the act of waiting, in itself  becomes the sole dramatic force.
For this reason, the emotion always feels coerced with Tarantino. He holds us ransom, then roofies our drink. Just look at how he uses Brad Pitt as the puppy to get us in the car for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Not only is Pitts sun-bronzed, Ray-Banned face plastered on bus shelters, the thought of seeing him as DiCaprios stunt double for an old black and white TV western is too alluring to deny.

The emotion always feels coerced with Tarantino. He holds us ransom, then roofies our drink.

So we eat it up: DiCaprio as Rick Dalton, star of Bounty Law (think The Rifleman), a gunslinger who gets his man and his money, and a lead actor who likes his liquor. Brad Pitt plays the handsome stunt double, Cliff, a cowboy who has no fear and a body that wont quit. Cliff is still capable of work, but when Bounty Law is cancelled, Rick takes him on as chauffeur  and general housekeeper, because something happened to Cliff along the way that makes him a bad risk to have around.

What does any of this have to do with Sharon Tate? Nothing. Except, in this story, Rick Dalton lives next-door to Sharon, played with comic grace by Margot Robbie. We watch different snippets of her life played out. Sharon and Roman driving in a  car. Sharon welcoming Polish friends of Romans. Sharon watch herself on screen at the local Beverly Hills cinema, realizing people are enjoying her performance in The Wrecking Crew.
This whole mega-meta exercise is played out using our own imaginations as the driver. We feel we know how it will play out, because we know what really happened. Tarantino gives us dates with each tableau, edging us closer to the shoulder, and finally, the big Cliff. Go ahead, rock your cranial hard-case, and see if you can remember all the details surrounding an event so horrible, youre already imagining the ugliest bits.

Tarantino knows this, which is why he makes us wait so long, giving us hints with each new character, and offering memory-tags with each newly doctored old film clip. Its clever, but like all things branded Tarantino, its also purely exploitative. Hes taking advantage of a true tragedy for his own dramatic purpose.

He tries to justify it by re-imagining the carnage in a way we can morally reconcile, but he still delivers the expected gore. In fact, he over-delivers. Enabled by an ear-pleasing soundtrack designed to yank us in, Tarantino cuts and slices. He pummels and stomps people to a pulp. Here, he smashes a womans head into a stone mantlepiece until it resembles pie.

Its clever, but like all things branded Tarantino, its also purely exploitative. Hes taking advantage of a true tragedy for his own dramatic purpose.

She was bad, obviously. But, why? Oh why, do I need to see a womans face reduced to pie? Or a mans cranium reduced to pulpy bits in the trunk of car? Or a baseball bat breaking an external carotid artery? Sure, all the victims were villains, but the Tarantino brand means taking it all to that extra level  and indulging in a form of graphic violence that excuses itself by deploying self-conscious humour and a good mix tape.

Its creepy. Its film fetishist, not cinemaphile. Tarantinos love of cinema, and his unfathomable desire to commune with its ephemeral essence, has rendered him a stalker. A gawker who wants to put his precious object of desire under a bell jar, which is why nothing in his films ever approaches love. Its all a self-aware mirror dance to affirm himself in a glamorous context, where women are almost always the victims of violence  executed with a branded touch of self-winking sarcasm.

Only the sexy glaze of stardom keeps us watching. And again, he knows that. Which is why he always casts A-listers, and plenty of them. This movie would be nothing without its stars, who are without much argument, two of the biggest in Hollywood. Nothing, not even the meandering bore of a plot,  can sweep away the sheer enjoyment of watching DiCaprio and Pitt work together. Its like watching a master class in bro  complete with a cameo from Steve McQueen (as played by English actor Damian Lewis).

Using their bodies to do most of the talking, as men do, the two actors perform an elegant dance together physically. They lean in and out. They pivot and glance. They touch. They notice touching. They are comfortable together. As men.

Too bad the director was too focused on the delivery of his own words to the lens, and missed all the real footwork   and the core of what hes so desperate to capture in every single one of his own frames: Masculinity.

Tarantino likes to make movies about tough guys with real problems, hitmen with a sense of humour. Clint Eastwood meets Woody Allen, only in a moral vacuum. The bullets blow away flesh without a hint of gravitas, and the viewer is left in this blood-spattered mess without any meaning.

Dot. Dot. Dot. Except one: Entertainment.

So if youre still into cliffhangers and base exploitation for the pleasure of the masses, or you simply cant resist the idea of visiting the backlots of Hollywood in the late 1960s, or cruising Ventura Boulevard with Brad Pitt and DiCaprio, Tarantino serves it up like a TV dinner: Flat and fragmented. Not that it matters. Half the fun is buying the package and the anticipation of brand satisfaction. The rest is dealing with the disappointment, and taking a second look at the box.

In this case it reads Once Upon a Time in Hollywood  which means all that crap in that box was put there on purpose. It all tastes the same. And its got Quentin Tarantinos name all over it.

PKE_Doc10_OnceUponATimeInHollywood,PKE,Comedy,Positive,Once upon a time in Hollywood,"The reign of the middle-aged white man is gradually coming to an end, so what does that mean for Quentin Tarantino, a director who burst onto the scene as an enfant terrible in the Nineties and has since carved himself out a niche in the movie-making establishment? In his ninth, and allegedly penultimate, feature Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (whose very trappings as an original movie shot on celluloid and banking on its star power hark back to the cinema of yesteryear), the film-maker stares down his own impending obsolescence, infusing the work with an unexpected poignance, a nostalgic yearning for a motion-picture paradise lost.
Once Upon a Time languidly unspools over three days in 1969, a golden time when movies cost 75, cigarettes are dipped in acid and barefoot Manson girls hitch rides along sun-soaked boulevards. Tarantino delights in amassing these details in the lush production design, piling period-specific pastiche atop paraphernalia to dazzling effect. The film is a rambling tale of epic proportions  crammed with winking B-movie-inspired vignettes and drawn-out scenes of Cadillacs cruising down freeways  that centres on the washed-up TV cowboy Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his body double/handyman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) as they struggle to bolster the formers waning career by reluctantly transitioning into movies.
It is nothing short of thrilling to see DiCaprio and Pitt onscreen together, each leading man propping up the other as more than a brother, a little less than a wife in a remarkably realised two-hander. The pair exudes an easy, companionable chemistry that is simply riveting: whether theyre kicking back with a few beers to watch FBI or Cliff is gently building up Ricks crumbling confidence before a shoot.

Pitts prowess for comedy  best showcased in his roles as a dim, money-grabbing personal trainer in Burn After Reading and a swaggering Nazi hunter in Inglourious Basterds  all too often goes underappreciated. In his portrayal of Cliff, smilingly carrying Ricks increasingly hefty emotional load, it is impossible to overlook the deftness of Pitts comic timing as he halts his counterparts spiralling neuroses with perfectly delivered put-downs (Dont cry in front of the Mexicans). Pitts performance is captivating, a smoothly mellow synergy of charisma and charm, but it is DiCaprio who steals the show, cementing his status as the best actor of his generation and, according to The Hollywood Reporter, the last true movie star we have in this franchise-led era.
DiCaprio may be at the height of his powers, Once Upon a Time marking his return to the silver screen following his long-overdue Oscar win, and yet his character is on a downward trajectory, an alcoholic with undiagnosed bipolar flailing for relevance in an industry indifferent to his crisis. (In many ways, the fading star could be interpreted as a stand-in for Tarantino himself: an artist steadfastly stuck in his ways, refusing to kowtow to the zeitgeist.)

Rick is surrounded by memories of his glories past that only exacerbate the depth of his decline. His stylish home on Cielo Drive is decked out with mementoes of his former greatness, his own face almost judgementally looking down on him from the movie posters and magazine covers mounted on the walls, as if asking their now-dishevelled self, Do you really need an eighth whiskey sour?. DiCaprio disappears into Rick, demonstrating a complete lack of vanity as he stammers and wheezes his way through scenes, snotting up phlegm and slurping frozen margaritas out of a blender with a buffoonish indignity.
And, just like Pitt, hes marvellously funny  an early scene of him bemusedly handling a flamethrower will have you erupting into laughter. In contrast to his co-star, who operates on free-flowing good vibes, DiCaprios humour tends to dip into the most soul-baring self-loathing. This comes to the fore when Rick has a temper-tantrum in his trailer after fluffing his lines on set. Captured in a series of rapid cuts, the sequence shows him screaming at his reflection and smashing up his belongings in an amusingly melodramatic fit. Then he threatens to commit suicide if he doesnt nail the next take. This crushing realisation of the extent of his despair truncates our pleasure and plays into the undercurrent of violence omnipresent in all Tarantino movies (although, on the whole, this ones brutality is less pronounced than its predecessors).
And what of Margot Robbie, you ask? She plays the actress Sharon Tate, who happens to be Ricks neighbour, sharing a lavish mansion on Beverly Hills with her husband Roman Polanski. As Ive said before, her screen time is frustratingly brief and largely silent. Once Upon a Time has edited in extra footage since its Cannes debut, although those additional minutes have mainly been allocated to the Western mise-en-abymes; Robbies part is still very small. However, within its confines, she does a laudable job, shading in her character with a buoyant corporeality and breezy optimism, dancing in and out of frame.
Watching Once Upon a Time is like flicking through a storybook, but instead of fairy-tale settings and moral imperatives, there are sweet-talking agents, drive-in theatres, dirty feet propped up on dashboards. Tarantino pieces together all these distinct elements to write a fantastically vibrant alternative history of Tinseltown in the Sixties, a love letter to cinema generally but also a fond remembrance of his own decorated oeuvre. By leaning into his insecurities for the future, the director has produced his most personal film to date. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a masterful achievement that is sure to be dissected by generations of movie-goers to come."
PHQ_Doc1_Cruella,PHQ,Comedy,Negative,Cruella,"Did you ever wonder how Cruella De Vil, the vampy fiend from Disney's ""101 Dalmatians,"" became evil enough to want to kill puppies and skin them for fur coats? You didn't? Ah, wellthere's a movie about it, ""Cruella."" It stars two Oscar-winning actresses, runs two hours and 14 minutes, and reportedly cost $200 million, a good chunk of it spent on an expansive soundtrack of familiar sixties and seventies pop songs. It never answers the burning question posed by its own existence, though: what new information could possibly make us sympathize with the original movie's nuclear family-loathing, wannabe-dog-killing monster? The further away from ""Cruella"" that you get, the more its connection to ""101 Dalmatians"" seems a cynical attempt to leash an existing Disney intellectual property to a story that has no organic connection with it. Directed by Craig Gillespiewho does a discount Scorsese, keeping the camera flying and the phonograph needles dropping, much as he did in ""I, Tonya""""Cruella"" awkwardly combines a couple of popular modes. One is the origin story of a long-lived, brand-name character that didn't need an origin story: think ""Solo: A Star Wars Story,"" ""Pan,"" and the third Indiana Jones (the opening sequence of The Last Crusade"" showed Indy acquiring his whip, his chin scar, his hat, and his fear of snakes in the space of 10 minutes). The other mode is the ""give the Devil his due"" story, represented on TV by dramas such as ""Bates Motel"" and ""Ratched"" and in cinema, with greater or lesser degrees of artistry, by Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" remakes, which explored the abusive childhood of serial killer Michael Myers; by the billion-dollar grossing, Oscar-winning ""Joker""; by Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" which gave Roald Dahl's inscrutable, faintly sinister clown Willy Wonka a tragic childhood; by the ""Maleficent"" films (the first of which had soul, at least); and by Broadway's Wicked, which presented the Wicked Witch as a victim of bigotry who embraced her own stereotype and used it as a weapon against tormenters. The ""Cruella"" screenplay is in that vein, or sometimes it tries to be. But it's a mess, and it often seems to pause to remind itself that it's supposed to have something to do with ""101 Dalmatians."" The script is credited to Dana Fox and Tony McNamara, from a story by Aline Brosh McKenna, Kelly Marcel, and Steve Zissis. But although it was theoretically inspired by a Disney cartoon feature adapted from Dodie Smith's book, you could change the heroine's name and take out a handful of iconic production design elements (such as Cruella's yin-yang hair and Bentley roadster, and the spotted dogs) and have a serviceable feature in the vein of ""Matilda,"" ""Madeline,"" or ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events""or, for that matter, countless Charles Dickens film adaptations, wherein a plucky child or teenager navigates a world of useless or treacherous adults, becoming embroiled in plots to steal this object or expose that bad person. Far from wanting to kill and skin dogs, a pre-Cruella girl named Estella (Emma Stone) owns one and dotes on it. As the story unfolds, we never see her being cruel to an animal or even saying an unkind word about them. She blames Dalmatians for the accidental death of her mother, a poor laundrywoman played by Emily Beecham; but that's more of a reflexive loathing, like hating the ocean if you'd lost a loved one to drowning. It's not as if she's sworn vengeance against canines generally. Our heroine (or antiheroine) is a sassy, plucky orphan who overcomes a life of deprivation on London's swingin' streets, joining up with a couple of buddies, Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) and running grifts and scams. A brilliant draftswoman with an eye for style, Estella gets a job at a big department store. In a fit of pique, she reconfigures a shop window display because it showcases a gown she thinks is ugly (altering it in the process), and is summarily hired by the store's biggest vendor, fashion designer Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson). The Baroness is a staff-abusing control freak who nevertheless becomes the closest thing to a mentor and mother that Estella has had since her own mum's death. Through a combination of incidents too tangled to recount here, the story morphs into an ""All About Eve"" riff about intergenerational rivalry between women in a creative workplace. Estella becomes increasingly resentful of the Baroness abusing her and stealing her glory; in time, she gradually learns what a vile person the Baroness is, and vows to humiliate and destroy her and usurp her spot as the top fashionista in London. All in all, not a bad setup for a knockabout comedy-drama set in what feels like an alternate universeone that's more clever and colorful than the one we're stuck with, although Jasper and Fry never quite feel like more than obligatory sidekicks, and Cruella is given a childhood best friend, Maya (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), a photojournalist and gossip columnist who is reduced to the status of a plot device in the film's second half. But Estella needs to become Cruella De Vil, just as Arthur Fleck had to become the Joker and Anakin Skywalker had to become Darth Vader, otherwise the production can't end up in theaters and on Disney+. And so ""Cruella,"" much like the half-charming, half-pointless ""Solo,"" has to shoehorn bits of lore and backstory and fanwankery into the narrative, none more risible than the moment where the heroine decides that Cruella needs an equally colorful last name and takes it from a certain model of automobile. Did we need that? Isn't the wordplay on ""Devil"" and ""da vil(lain)"" sufficient? Apparently not, and of course, young children are going to eat that sort of thing right up, even though its (amazingly) even worse than the scene in ""Solo"" where the intergalactic customs official assigns the hero his last name because he's traveling alone. It's a bummer, really, becauselike many a ""How did this person become the character we already know?"" films""Cruella"" is filled with situations, set pieces, and moments of characterization and performance that suggest it had everything required to stand on its own two high-heeled feet, minus the guardrails of intellectual property owned by the largest entertainment conglomerate the world has ever seen. Estella's rightful desire to punish a bad person, for example, is intertwined with her drive to succeed in business, a touch of psychological complexity that the script isn't interested in unpacking because it already has its hands full making Estella a lively character in her own right and simultaneously setting her up to become Cruella de Vila transformation that makes increasingly less sense the more you learn about the character. A pity, that. People in real life often do good things for bad reasons and vice versa, or use their trauma as an excuse to lower themselves to the level of the person they've decided is (to quote Bond's nemesis Blofeld) the author of all their pain. Because the film cant, or wont, deal with the material thats  right in front of it, it comes across seeming as if it wants credit for a sophistication it does not possess. There's no denying that ""Cruella"" is stylish and kinetic, with a nasty edge that's unusual for a recent Disney live-action feature. But it's also exhausting, disorganized, and frustratingly inert, considering how hard it works to assure you that it's thrilling and cheeky. You get forty minutes into it and realize the main story hasn't started yet. Were it not for the acrobatic camerawork, the game lead performances by two Emmas, and the parade of eye-popping costumes by Jenny Beavaneighty knockouts in 134 minutes, not counting the period-inspired background garb on the extrasit would be a nonsensical heap of broken images, as aesthetically bankrupt as ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" and the first ""Suicide Squad."" More vexing is the films reluctance to own the fact thatas one of many obvious song cues assure usit has Sympathy for the Devil. She's not really the devilnot even remotely, as the script keeps telling usbut she is an awful person in many ways, and we are expected to adore her because the Baroness is so much worse. The movie hits a giddy peak in its final act when it becomes a contest of wills. Its here that the leads cut loose. Thompson in particular achieves cartoonish grandiosity, a supervillain armored in haute couture. Every head tilt, sneer, and side-eye is a non-physical assault on the Baroness' enemies and underlings, some of who don't realize they've been symbolically executed until their heads hit the basket. The effect is similar to what Cate Blanchett achieved in ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" another film where the costumes were practically giving performances of their own, and the smartest actors in the cast knew how to merge with them. But ""Cruella"" never embraces darkness in the way it keeps threatening to. There's nothing in this film remotely as powerful as the moment in the first ""Maleficent"" when the heroine awakens on a hilltop after spending the night with a duplicitous man and finds that her wings have been chopped off. It's an atrocity that reads as a sexual and psychological assault even though the movie never frames it that way, and it powers us through the rest of the story, freeing us to root for a traumatized, outcast monster. ""Maleficent"" eventually compromises, too, pulling back from its heroine's grimmest tendencies. But it's still as close as Disney has gotten to letting Satan footnote the Bible, and it looks better every time the studio releases something like ""Cruella,"" a movie that flinches from its own premise, even as it looks great doing it."
PHQ_Doc2_Cruella,PHQ,Comedy,Positive,Cruella,"Kindly step back and make way for a sensational couple of Emmas: Stone and Thompson. Together, they are the highly strung dysfunctional double-act that post-lockdown cinema didnt know it needed. Theres an unexpectedly huge amount of old-fashioned fun to be had in Disneys spectacular new origin-myth story from screenwriters Aline Brosh McKenna, Kelly Marcel and Steve Zissis, prebooting Cruella de Vil, the wicked dognapper from One Hundred and One Dalmatians. She is now an icily supercool supervillain, and Stone gives it everything shes got  which is a considerable amount  as Estella, a young orphan girl with a genetic quirk of black-and-white hair. I was hoping for some Susan Sontag gags, but you cant have everything. She grows up in glam-rock London of the mid-1970s, a world of Izal loo paper, Ford Anglia police cars and Golden Wonder crisps, living in a Faginesque thieves lair presided over by two dodgy scallywags, Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser), who took her in when she was a stroppy homeless waif and schooled her in the ways of thievery. And Thompson gives it everythings shes got  which is a considerable amount, and then some  as an imperious fashion designer called the Baroness with a prestige outlet at Libertys department store in Londons stately West End. Young Estella idolises this aristocrat of couture because she wants to be a fashionista just like her. So when supportive Jasper and Horace fake her a CV, claiming that she played polo with Prince Charles, Estella nabs a Cruella-de-Vil-wears-Prada apprenticeship with this grande dame. But then she is consumed with a need to destroy her haughty mentor, to reinvent herself as a punk-genius brand-named Cruella; its all got something to do with Estellas poor, well-meaning mum, played by Emily Beecham, and the Baronesss ferocious three Dalmatians to which Estella takes a dislike. Its all extremely entertaining, although I do have to say that in these snowflakey days of emotional correctness and respect for animals, this movie rather fudges the whole question of Cruella actually wanting, now or in the future, to kill Dalamatians for their skins. Maybe theres a bit too much Hannibal Lecter energy, because the film sidesteps and pirouettes around that bit of nastiness, which was a feature both of the 1961 animation and of course Dodie Smiths 1956 novel. Youll have to hang on for the post-credits sting by the way, but that just makes the animal cruelty in Cruella even more puzzling by implication. But what a lavish display, with repeated jukebox slams on the soundtrack keeping the movies blood-sugar levels high, although they didnt use a certain Michael Jackson track which surely would have been perfect for a Dalmatians-themed film. The big screen is surely the place to marvel at the films digital recreation of London in the mid-70s, with top-notch work from costume designer Jenny Beavan and production designer Fiona Crombie, who lay on the outrageous accoutrements with a trowel. There are times when Cruellas young womanhood is a mixture of Sleeping Beauty and Heath Ledgers Joker. Nowadays, there is hardly a classic female villain who hasnt been reinvented or origin-mythed on a quasi-feminist basis. (Maybe the three witches in Macbeth should get this treatment, starring Millie Bobby Brown, Elle Fanning and Kirby Howell-Baptiste  whos actually in this film, playing Estellas smart mate, Anita.) But the politics of Cruella de Vil are more generational than sexual. She wants to be like her role-model heroine and then wipe her out. Its not the dogs skin Cruella wants to rip off and wear, its the Baronesss. She wants to inhabit and destroy."
PHQ_Doc3_Cruella,PHQ,Comedy,Positive,Cruella,"In the original, animated 101 Dalmatians, there was nothing black-and-white about Cruella de Vil. As her name less implied, more flat-out screamed, she was a Disney villain drawn delightfully, deliciously dark. Kudos, then, to director Craig Gillespie for pulling off a live-action prequel that adds a few shades of grey without muddying the character one bit, leaning into Cruellas inherent flamboyance for a slick and stylish clothing caper. Unlike the Sleeping Beauty villain-reimagining Maleficent, which tied itself in narrative knots attempting to retool the classic fairy tale, Cruella wisely divorces itself from the context of the original film. Where that was released in 1961, based on Dodie Smiths novel from the 50s, this largely takes place in the 1970s  recontextualising Cruellas raucous sartorial stylings as a punk explosion, railing against conformity and scoffing at the safety of the Swinging Sixties. Its a colourful background for a reimagined origin story that takes a young Estella (an impressive Tipper Seifert-Cleveland in an opening act coursing with Matilda-esque mischief) and morphs her into the cackling Cruella via a life of crime, a stint on the shop floor of Liberty, and a job at the most fearsome fashion house in London. What could have been a mere IP cash-in instead becomes an unexpectedly cinematic crime-and-couture romp. The result is a tale of two Emmas. Central, of course, is Stone, teasing out Estellas encroaching evil while retaining all the charismatic screen presence thats defined her career so far  and pulling off a decent British accent to boot. Among the theatricality (in one scene she tumbles onto a red carpet from a bin lorry in a giant rubbish-dress) and the two-tone wigs, she finds moments of humanity without diminishing Cruellas delectable extremity. But its Emma Thompson who threatens to steal the film as The Baroness  a fashion boss whose cutthroat nature extends well beyond the catwalk. Whether shes slashing at garments with a straight razor, loudly reading her own rave reviews, or calling people imbeciles with fatal levels of derision, shes a killer creation. Thompson plays it to absolute perfection, running away with every scene shes in. The pair are so much fun that other players struggle to get a look-in. Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser entertain as Estellas comrades-in-crime, but Mark Strongs valet, John, sinks into the background, Kirby Howell-Baptistes journalist Anita (a nod to the original Dalmatians) appears often while saying little, and John McCreas Bowie-esque, androgynous boutique owner Artie is a disappointingly fleeting presence  hes intriguing enough to deserve his own film. Though Cruella could easily lose 20 minutes, Gillespie keeps the energy high throughout. The Scorsesean riffs he brought to I, Tonya continue here, from a stacked soundtrack of 60s and 70s greats (The Clash, Blondie, The Stooges), to a stunning extended tracking shot through the halls of Liberty. What could have been a mere IP cash-in instead becomes an unexpectedly cinematic crime-and-couture romp, delivered with the sort of style, snarl and eccentricity that Cruella herself would likely applaud. She makes being bad look very good."
PHQ_Doc4_Cruella,PHQ,Comedy,Negative,Cruella,"With her shock of black-and-white hair and crimson color scheme, Cruella de Vil is one of Disneys most durable villains. She made for a terrifying antagonist in the delightful 1961 animated film One Hundred and One Dalmatians, and gave Glenn Close some delectable scenery to chew in 101 Dalmatians, an otherwise forgettable 1996 live-action version. Now, Emma Stone tries her hand at playing a would-be puppy killer in Cruella, an origin story that achieves the dubious feat of being tedious, transgressive, chaotic and inert at the same time. It should surprise no one that in Cruella, it comes to light that Cruellas mean-spiritedness and Dalmatian-hating tendencies have their roots in a primal loss  here, the result of a Disney-esque momicide. As an orphan running amok on London streets in the early 1960s, young Cruella is still known by her birth name, Estella, and harbors dreams of becoming a fashion designer while pulling petty heists with the good humored neer-do-wells Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) and Jasper (Joel Fry). When a chance encounter results in Estella becoming an apprentice to a revered designer named the Baroness (Emma Thompson), she finally gets a chance to let her gifts emerge; she also learns that creative genius and bad behavior are joined at the perfectly sheathed hip. Driven by an over-insistent soundtrack that ranges from the Beatles, Stones and Supertramp to Nina Simone and Blondie, and drawing inspiration from English fashion trends spanning Carnaby Street boho chic to the trashed-out aesthetic of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, Cruella isnt a movie as much as its a mood board come aggressively to life. This makes for some admittedly spectacular set pieces, especially when they revolve around Jenny Beavans wildly imaginative costumes and Tom Daviess divine eyewear. Channeling the haughty couture of The Devil Wears Prada and Phantom Thread  with a dash of Scott Rudin thrown in for toxic measure  Thompson plays the Baroness with sang-froid bordering on psychopathology: In one scene she slashes Estellas hand and instead of apologizing, simply directs her fabric department to match that precise shade of red. As witheringly funny as Thompson is in Cruella, finding humor in abuse of power feels queasily out of step with the current moment (op. cit., Rudin). Things get even trickier when it comes to the title character, who despite Stones best efforts never becomes more interesting than just a nasty-natured person awash in self-pity and revenge. Taking a page from Joker here and Suicide Squad there, director Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) and his team of screenwriters want to ground their antiheroines antisocial rage and violence in psychological loss. But, surrounded by characters who are just as unpleasant as she is, Stones Cruella simply becomes one more person behaving badly in a story overstuffed with incident for its own sake. Stone actually delivers an accomplished performance in Cruella, credibly assuming an arch English accent along with dramatic makeup and myriad black-and-white wigs. Fry and Hauser  the latter doing his best Ray Winstone impression  bring Dickensian sweetness to their roles. (Mark Strong, unfortunately, is wasted as the Baronesss stone-faced aide-de-camp.) But whatever good intentions were brought to bear in Cruella are lost in an overlong, awkwardly shaped mash-up of coming-of-age drama, caper flick, action adventure and fashion world sendup. The constant barrage of needle drops from classic rock songs results in feeling bludgeoned into submission by a movie constantly trying to prove its hip bona fides. The climactic reveal of Cruellas most notorious design (involving those Dalmatians and a showstopping coat) is first staged as an act of punk-rock subversion and ultimately as a brand-saving, Who me? hoax. Such is the challenge of Cruella: making a charmless figure at least sympathetic enough to care about watching, while softening her most inhumane actions only as much as the original character will bear. Its not an easy needle to thread, especially in an atelier as miserably misanthropic as this one."
PHQ_Doc5_Cruella,PHQ,Comedy,Positive,Cruella,"In 1996, Glenn Close glided onto screens in fur and feathers, with an electric shock of a black-and-white wig perched on her head and a cackle that could summon the dead. Her take on Cruella de Vil, in Disneys live-action adaptation of its 1961 animated classic 101 Dalmatians, has, for a long time, felt positively definitive. And so, its a great compliment to Emma Stones performance in Cruella playing a young, mostly reimagined version of the character  that it never feels as if shes wrestling with the shadow of her predecessor. Here, the characters been transplanted to the Seventies, right as the punk movement raged through the streets of London and came scratching up against the door of the establishment. Stones lightly parodic, aristocratic English twang has been borrowed from her Broadway debut as Sally Bowles in the 2014 production of Cabaret. But she dips every one of her lines in champagne and truffles, relishing every dahling that passes her lips. Shes a perfect centrepiece for a film like Cruella. Wickedly stylish and an absolute gas, its essentially a fashion film, full of immaculate gowns and unabashed showmanship. Dana Fox and Tony McNamaras script has Cruella simply be a nickname given to Estellas natural mean streak, which shes done to well bury as a promise to her kindly (and very dead) mother Catherine (Emily Beecham). Its a far less aggressive attempt to rehabilitate a villain than 2014s Maleficent, which poured buckets of tragedy onto Sleeping Beautys relatively simple story of a sorceress peeved that she wasnt invited to a party. Cruella was never good, just in denial. Director Craig Gillespie is content to pull back and let costume designer Jenny Beavan (who memorably won an Oscar for Mad Max: Fury Road) tell the bulk of the story through her heavenly creations. As Estella grimly scales the fashion industry ladder, she comes up against the ferocious Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson), finding herself both repulsed and enchanted by such a narcissistic genius. Cruella sees a war waged in silk, leather, and lace, with Estellas DIY aesthetics - her outfits seemingly cobbled together from fabric scraps - pitted against the precise silhouettes of the Baronesss traditional, Dior-esque fashion house. What we later see from a fully realised Cruella is a mixture of both, in a clever nod to the way Vivienne Westwood, one of the original fashion punks, adopted and subverted fashion history as she gained mainstream success. And, since the clothes do most of the work, its everyone elses job simply to keep up. Nicholas Britells jazzy score is paired with an entire jukeboxs worth of vintage hits - whod have ever thought that The Stoogess I Wanna Be Your Dog, thick with sexual overtones, would end up in a Disney film? Gillespie, meanwhile, keeps the film looking slick and elegant, including a nod to Goodfellass famous tracking shot through the Copacabana, as the camera winds through the underbelly of Londons Liberty department store. Stones performance is commanding enough not to be swallowed up by the wigs and costumes, while she sprinkles in a little wounded pride to lend a sense of genuine pathos to Cruellas madness. But the film belongs equally to her onscreen rival - and Thompson is brilliantly despicable, landing somewhere in between The Devil Wears Pradas Miranda Priestly and Phantom Threads Reynolds Woodcock. The actor keeps Stone on her toes, lest she sweeps the film right from under her. While Joel Frys Jasper, Paul Walter Hausers Horace, and Kirby Howell-Baptistes Anita Darling lend softness and heart to the film, the real pleasure here is watching two formidable comic actors tear into each other while dressed to the nines. Cruella is the most fashionable dogfight of the year."
PHQ_Doc6_Cruella,PHQ,Comedy,Negative,Cruella,"Its time to make some trouble. You in? reads one of the posts promoting Cruella, Disneys prequel-meets-reconsideration of the classic One Hundred and One Dalmatians villain. The line is in keeping with the film: Its slick and witty and teasingly imprecise about what trouble, in this context, might entail. Previous incarnations of Cruella de Vilincluding the 1961 animated film that gave us a song dedicated to her vilenesshave paid fealty to the characters outlandish fiendishness: This is someone who will attempt to murder puppies in order to make outerwear. The new version, which tells of Cruellas life as a young fashion designer, both complicates and flattens the existing stories. Played with off-kilter aplomb by Emma Stone, the young Cruella is a hustler, a skilled self-promoter, and an influencer. She is not evil; she is merely complicated. She is a creature of 2020s America who happens to reside in 1970s London. Cruella is the latest entry in the thriving genre of villain revisionism. The field includes lightly fictionalized reconsiderations of nonfictional events (works such as Confirmation and The People v. O. J. Simpson); documentaries such as The Clinton Affair, Lorena, and Framing Britney Spears; and retellings of old tales (Wicked, Maleficent) from the villains point of view. The genre is not new, but it is flourishing in an age shaped by the internet and fluent in the language of postmodernism: It tells the story about the story. It is deeply concerned with the totalizing power of authorship. It understands that villainy, as a category, is imposedand that, in a culture that tends to prioritize reductive myths over complicated truths, the label can be its own kind of injustice. Disneys latest film is both an apotheosis and a nadir of the form. It goes out of its way to complicate, to relate, to correct. It takes a character so evilso delightfully depravedthat she is named after the devil himself, and promises that she, too, can be rehabilitated. Its impulse toward retrospective empathy, however, strains credulity. (When a reassessment depends on the murderous capabilities of a dalmatian named Genghis, perhaps it has gone too far.) The Cruella you might know from earlier iterations is all but unrecognizable. Her defining cruelty has been switched out for the demands of glossy, girlboss feminism. Cruella is often fun to watchit features some fantastic performances, some excellent lines, and some dazzling clothesbut its cavalier reversal of its core character cheapens the very idea of a corrective narrative. It takes a quintessential villain and nuances her character into oblivion. Here is one simple way to render your villain instantly sympathetic: You make her the victim of trauma. Cruella begins, as many Disney stories do, with a child witnessing the death of a beloved parent. In this case, Cruella blames herself for the tragedy. Orphaned, she makes her way to London, where she takes up with two boys (this is how Jasper and Horace, Cruellas eventual henchmen, enter the story). The three support themselves through thievery; she puts her great design skills to work creating elaborate costumes that enable their grifts. Everything changes when Jasper, recognizing her talent, gets her a job at a high-end department store. That leads to a job with the Baroness, the apex predator of Londons fashion scene. Cruella quickly discoversand, warning, here are some spoilersthat the Baroness was responsible for her mothers death. Driven by a desire for revenge, which might also be a desire for justice (the film is unclear on this crucial distinction), Cruella becomes a fashion star intent on displacing the Baroness. Heists and society balls and operatic plot twists ensue. At no point, in this film based on 101 Dalmatians, does Cruella put dogs lives under threat. She makes some winking jokes about killing dogs and, for that matter, people. It is crucial to the films project that she never follows through. This Cruella is bad but not evil, and much depends on the difference. Instead, the cruelty in Cruella is outsourced: The villain is the Baroness, played with razor-sharp hauteur by Emma Thompson. She is calculating and cutting (sometimes literally: She nicks Cruella with a fabric cutter and, enchanted by the blood rather than abashed by it, orders staff to procure a fabric in the same color). She says things like Youre helpful to me, is all. As soon as youre not, youre dust. The Baroness is emblematic of the films frenzied effort to have things both ways. The original Cruella is a great villain in part because her evil is so delightfully two-dimensional, so transcendentally cartoonish. She utters deliciously demonic lines (Poison them! Drown them! Bash them! Drop them on their head! Got any chloroform?) about adorable puppies. But Cruella, having argued that its main character is fundamentally good, cedes that depravity to the Baroness. As for Cruella, the traumatized orphan? She is seen scrubbing toilets (her job at the department store, it turns out, is janitorial) and being belittled by an imperious manager. The bids for sympathy are heavy-handed. How will Cruella finally break bad? Unclear. And not the point. Another way that the film complicates its compassions: Cruella, in this rendering, is not one person but two. The characters most defining physical featureher starkly split-colored hairhas a psychological upshot. She is both Cruella (who is born brilliant, born bad, and a little bit mad) and Estella (who loved her mother and is essentially kind, if rebellious). This is a well-worn trope: Cruella/Estella is a version of Clark and Kal-El, Arthur and Joker, Jekyll and Hyde. But the bifurcation is so muddled that Cruella herself has to constantly clarify which of her alter egos she is embracing at a given moment. Im Cruella, she will say, to her colleagues and the fourth wall. Are you Cruella or Estella? other characters will ask. In some stories, the alter ego can be a way of exploring the elemental idea that people have dual, and sometimes dueling, capacities for goodness and badness. Here, though, the trope is used in much the same way that childhood trauma is: as a plot device, and as a way of making Cruella a character who offers something for everyone. Is Cruella good or bad? She is both. She is neither. She is exceptional. She is relatable. After a whileCruella has a two-plus-hour running timeall the whiplash begins to look like indifference. The films efforts to frame its protagonist as a feminist antihero take the form of easy currency. Helen Reddys I Am Woman, Hear Me Roar is referenced unironically. In one scene, the Baroness utters the line I choose me. The whole thing can read, at times, as a game of corporate-feminist Mad Libs made corporeal. Each film is only as good as its villain, Roger Ebert once observed, and the older Dalmatians films show why. Their stories have been elevated by Cruellas delicious deviance. In her recent book, Women and Other Monsters: Building a New Mythology, Jess Zimmerman quotes Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, the dean of humanities at Arizona State University: The monster dwells at the gates of difference, he notes, in one of the insights that inform his seminal book Monster Theory. Monsters, Zimmerman argues, separate acceptable from unacceptable, whats allowed from what is not. Their monstrosity is deviation blown up to exaggerated sizethe mythic equivalent of if you keep doing that, your face will stick that way.. This is part of the visceral thrill of cinematic villainy. Villains tend to be much more entertaining to watch than heroes because their embrace of aberrance can be cathartic: They acknowledge the constraints imposed by cultures that are narrow in their empathiesand then studiously ignore them. Many of Disneys greatest villains are coded as queer for this reason. (The Little Mermaids Ursula was inspired by Divine, the famous drag queen.) These characters dwell at the gates of difference and, crucially, have no interest in residing anywhere else. Cruella nods to that transgressive powerand also reduces it. The queer character here, Artie (John McCrea), is not a villain but a friend of Cruellas who happily agrees to serve as one of her assistants. Several other people in the film, two of them characters of colorincluding Cruellas childhood friend Anita Darling (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), a main character of 101 Dalmatiansare similarly cast as cheerful agents of Cruellas will. For a movie premised on corrective vision, these treatments are notably myopic. Cruella adopts The Queens Gambit idea of success; its plot assumes that everyone in Cruellas world will happily drop what theyre doing to help her exact her revenge (or is it justice?). The film insists that her success is success for anyone who has been marginalized. She is an outsider, after all. Her clothes suggest the avant-gardism of Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen. And yet: I want to be like you, she tells the Baroness. Youre a very powerful woman. So Disney has given us an allegedly punk antihero whose defining goal is to be respected within the establishment. Every age gets the Cruella it deserves. The Cruella of the 1990s, an era whose mass culture was inflected by feminist backlash, was made monstrous not just by her murderousness, but also by her acute disinterest in marrying or mothering. (Puppies, darling, coos Glenn Close, infusing the role with maniacal glee. Ive no use for babies.) The Cruella of the current momentfrenzied, flattenedis an icon for a time that finds the slogans of empowerment easy and the substance of empowerment hard. The film embraces the glib condescension of the idea that every villain must be, somehow, misunderstoodthat a woman cant be purely evil, that she must have a softer side, that her currency is her beguiling relatability. Watching this sumptuous revision, I longed for the classic Cruella: vain, vapid, willing to kill puppies, and never feeling the need to explain herself."
PHQ_Doc7_Cruella,PHQ,Comedy,Negative,Cruella,"There's a lot of Cruella-splaining, much of it from her own mouth, in Disney's origin story about the puppy-napper we think we know. As a young woman, the pre-Cruella is a talented, aspiring fashion designer named Estella, who lives in a 1970s London full of punk style and pop music. Emma Stone brings a winning charm to Estella and a languorous glamour to the unscrupulous Cruella she morphs into, who tries to take over the fashion world while avenging her mother's death. Revenge has rarely looked so stylish. The film's true heroine, though, is its costume designer Jenny Beavan, who takes inspiration from Alexander McQueen and other eye-popping designers. If its narrative had been as bold as its design, Cruella might have been spikier, more radical and more surprising. But this crowd-pleasing, sometimes fun revision only makes half-hearted moves in that direction. It fits all-too-neatly into a burgeoning trend of movies that put villains at the centre and reveal how they came to be so rotten. The character of Cruella was purely evil in the animated 1961 classic One Hundred and One Dalmatians and its 1996 live-action remake with Glenn Close. But since 2014, we've seen Disney's two Maleficent films with Angelina Jolie, as well as more acerbic origin stories in DC's Joker and Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn). Like them, the new Cruella exists to explain but not excuse a cartoon villain, and to grab the commercial success likely to come from a popular character too exciting to waste. After all, who is the most memorable non-canine in the Dalmatians movies? The characters turn bad for reasons that are not intriguing in themselves: a broken heart for Maleficent; a warped childhood for the Joker and Cruella; and both for Harley Quinn. The trick is to make these outsized villains interesting in the days before they become evil, which Cruella tries hard to do but doesn't quite accomplish. The film begins with her birth and Stone's voiceover wryly saying, ""Oh, no  starting here?"" For the next 20 minutes, we hear Stone's running commentary intrude on action we can observe perfectly well. As a child, Estella (played by Tipper Seifert-Cleveland), born with black hair on one side and white on the other, fights bullies that say she looks like a skunk. Her lovely single mother calls Estella's inner bad girl Cruella, a sign that the evil one might just be lurking, waiting to get out. Her mother mysteriously visits the mansion of the haughty fashion designer Baroness Von Hellman, and dies while a sumptuous Marie-Antoinette-themed costume ball, full of towering wigs and towering cakes, is in progress. Estella runs off to London, takes up with two street urchins named Horace and Jasper to form a trio of pickpockets, and dyes her hair red as Stone takes over the adult role. Horace and Jasper are the henchmen of the classic Cruella story, but here they are Estella's surrogate family and great assets to the film. Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) is a bumbler who adds comedy and Jasper (Joel Fry) the sensitive one who adds heart. Stone makes Estella a likeable, Bohemian rebel despite the petty larceny, but the film is really marking time until her inevitable dark turn. Reenter the villainous Baroness, impeccably played by Emma Thompson with a witty edge. When she spots a punk, graffiti-filled store window Estella designed, she hires her to work at her fashion house. There, Thompson makes the Baroness deliciously self-absorbed as she swans around, snapping at her minions, occasionally wearing turbans that evoke Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard and hint at her near future as a has-been. She also comes with an ominous black-and-white motif on her floor tiles, and with the three aggressive Dalmatians. Half-way through, the film finally takes off, as Estella discovers the Baroness' malice and becomes the vengeance-seeking Cruella, mimiking the Baroness's slash of red lipstick and arrogant manner. She goes back to her black-and-white hair and adds dramatic dark eye makeup, grabbing newspaper headlines with her own fashion, and posing on top of a car in a snug jacket worn with a voluminous red skirt. As motives go, avenging your mother's death is better than what drives most screen villains, but when Cruella even becomes imperious toward poor, loyal Horace and Jasper, it is the truest sign of her decaying soul. When the costumes overwhelm the characters and story, there's something hollow at the film's centre. There is as much talent off-screen as on here, although too often it is squeezed into a formula. The director, Craig Gillespie, brings the crispness and taste for dark wit that he displayed in I, Tonya, especially when Cruella, Horace and Jasper stage a caper to steal a necklace she lost as a girl. But much of the action is clichd, such as a long tracking shot through the Liberty London store. The screenplay, by Dana Fox (Isn't It Romantic) and Tony McNamara (The Favourite), has just enough sharp lines  Cruella blithely says, ""Must dash. Much to avenge, revenge and destroy""  to make you wonder if an edgy script was watered down, or a tame one goosed-up. Even the score, by the great Nicholas Britell (Succession, Moonlight) is overshadowed by the soundtrack's pop songs, some as lively as Blondie's One Way or Another, others as predictable as the Rolling Stones' Sympathy for the Devil. Beavan's costumes are dazzling throughout, including Cruella's glittering red dress at the Baroness's gala. But when the costumes overwhelm the characters and story, there's something hollow at the film's centre. Maybe half-heartedness is the best we can expect from villain origin stories, which always want their characters to be good and bad, having things both ways. In Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn tells a child: ""For what it's worth, you made me want to be a less terrible person."" That might be the motto for the entire genre, and that's where Cruella leaves us, with a lukewarm villain who regrets being mean to her friends and has not so much as sneered at a dog. Not yet.       "
PHQ_Doc8_Cruella,PHQ,Comedy,Positive,Cruella,"This live-action Disney origin story stars Emma Stone as a fashion doyennes assistant and is being hyped as a fresh take on The Devil Wears Prada. Its actually more convoluted than that tag would suggest. Id go so far as to say that the plot is a bit of a dogs dinner. Not to worry. When it counts, Craig Gillespies blockbuster proves delicious. We get our kicks, these days, by falling in love with iconic villains. Maleficent. The Joker. Right now, the spotlights on 101 Dalmatians fashion-crazed, dog-killing aristocrat, Cruella de Vil. Via prequels, supposedly beyond-the-pale figures get to tell their side of the story, exposing past tragedies and mental vulnerability. Such succulent roles, naturally, attract top actors. Joaquin Phoenix won an Oscar for his turn as Arthur Fleck. Stone deserves to be nominated, at the very least, for her exquisitely witty and emotionally raw performance. The given name of the films anti-heroine is Estella and we first meet her as a babe in arms. Estellas mum, Catherine (Emily Beecham), clearly oblivious to the dangers of encouraging the development of an evil alter ego, dubs her daughter Cruella whenever the kid misbehaves.  la Matilda, this extraordinary child is a natural iconoclast. When it comes to fashion, shes also an autocratic, unethical brat. Estella is wildly impressed by a gown that contains chiffon and  shudder!  fur. An unfortunate incident leaves Estella mother-less and wracked with guilt. Cruella, she decides, needs to stay in the closet. Years later, shes living in 70s London with fellow orphans Horace and Jasper (Paul Walter Hauser and Joel Fry) and bags a job working for a tyrannical fashion designer, the Baroness (an on-form Emma Thompson, as camp as she is gothic). Every now and again, Estella bumps into her nice old school friend, Anita (Kirby Howell-Baptiste; wryly wholesome), a photographer and gossip columnist for the amusingly-titled Tittle-Tattle magazine. Then new facts come to light and Estella stops blaming herself for her mothers death. Uh-oh  here comes trouble. Once Estella releases her inner Cruella, the verbal and visual fireworks never let up. This is one of the kookiest London movies you will ever see and British costume designer Jenny Beavan, always astounding, finds a way to surpass herself. A second-hand-boutique on the Portobello Road, run by Artie (a scene-stealing John McCrea), is uncannily like the real thing. You can all but smell the damp n mothballs on those gorgeously clumpy vintage dresses. Estella expresses herself through her increasingly punky, Vivienne Westwood-ish designs. Theres a dress made of rubbish thats as magical as a Cirque du Soleil show, and homage to Alexander McQueen is paid in a variety of ways, most thrillingly through a couture outfit with a wickedly fluttery core. The frocks dont distract from a script that wants to understand decadence, corruption, pent-up sexual longing and the rage of the underdog  the frocks tell the story. Taken as a whole, Cruella is a perfect riposte to film fans who think every epic needs guns and gangsters. An extended tracking shot, that apparently takes us through the bowels of legendary department store Liberty, is as kinetic as anything in Goodfellas. Will children be mystified by such goings on? Maybe, but two adorable dogs  one of them a tiny and agile pup called Winks  should keep them on board. That and the reassuring presence of Anita, who actually looks the same age as her former pal (I could never understand why, in the hilarious 1961 cartoon, 50-fags-a-day Cruella seemed twice as old as Anita. Smoking ages you, sure, but still). Younguns will also lap up the splendid banter between Horace and Jasper, delivered with finesse by Hauser and Fry. With his large appetite, Horace comes close to being the butt of some obvious jokes, yet he ends up delivering some of the smartest and sweetest lines. Estella tells her two friends that she views them as her family. Shes pulling the family card! yelps wise Horace. Cruella the movie is all about family. Despite the 12A certificate, Cruellas eyes take us to some very dark places. And though her signature hair-do might suggest otherwise, her world view is anything but black and white. Suffice to say, this devil does not wear fur and having sympathy for her feels like the start of something beautiful."
PHQ_Doc9_Cruella,PHQ,Comedy,Positive,Cruella,"Theres not much of One Hundred and One Dalmatians author Dodie Smiths source material or its classic 1961 animated adaptation to be found inside Disneys Cruella, and Im perfectly okay with that. Transplanted to a punk rock London of the 1970s, this isnt so much an origin story for the iconic fashionista villainous with a murderous thing for spotted puppy fur as it is an alternate reality where a similar character takes her first stiletto-heeled steps into her own fabulously coifed tomorrow. Directed by I, Tonya and Lars and the Real Girl filmmaker Craig Gillespie and with a story and script credited to five writers (including The Favourite scribe Tony McNamara and The Devil Wears Prada screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna), the finished product can feel a bit messy, especially during its convoluted second act. But the opening hour is dazzling, while the climax is a crackerjack barnburner of suitably cartoonish rage and whimsically rambunctious adrenaline. The film is a heck of a lot of fun, and even at 134-minutes it still managed to keep my full attention for the most of its epic running time. Estella (Emma Stone) is a twenty-something orphan living on the London streets with her two best friends and partners in pickpocket crime Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser). The young woman has talent as a seamstress and fashion designer, and she harbors dreams of going to work for the legendary Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson). When the opportunity to do so arises seemingly by chance, after earning the Baroness trust and becoming a valuable member of her design team, Estella is shocked to discover her icon harbors a devasting homicidal secret directly connected to the tragic death of her mother roughly a decade prior. Determined to exact revenge, she develops a colorfully aggressive alter ego named Cruella, a rival up-and-coming designer who wants to dethrone the fashion industrys reigning queen. Its not a ton of plot, and as elaborate as the scenario gets, there still isnt a valid reason for this story to be stretched out to well over two hours. But that opening section is incredible. There is a passionate female-centered strength to the world Gillespie has created thats exceptional, and the ways he allows Stone so much freedom to make Estella/Cruella her own cannot be understated. The fusion between actor and character is seamless, and I loved the underlying emotional ferocity which hypnotically fuels her performance. As terrific as Stone is, however, Thompson comes remarkably close to stealing the motion picture right out from underneath her co-star. The Baroness is a magnificent villain, her venal self-righteous narcissism beyond anything I could have imagined. Thompson brings a level of sanctimonious sincerity to the proceedings thats sublime, her lithe, almost serpentine physicality adding an additional layer I found impossible to resist. There is a point where things begin to stumble and fall apart. The seams start to show, and Gillespie has to rely on a few well-placed needle drops to help keep narrative momentum moving forward at a spirited clip. This is a bit lazy in my opinion, and I do wish hed have allowed Nicholas Britells (Moonlight) fabulous score to do more of the musical heavy-lifting instead of turning to the likes of The Rolling Stones, Ike & Tina Turner, The Clash, The J. Geils Band, Judy Garland, Blondie, Queen and many others for a far-too-obvious assist. Other areas I could pick a few nits include how Jasper and Horace are sidelined during the laborious middle section and the almost inexcusable way in which Anita Darling (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) is utilized as a prop and not a full-blown character. Theres also a vital subplot involving The Baroness trusted valet John (Mark Strong) which is far too contrived to satisfy, and I may have rolled my eyes during a pivotal reveal involving the characters connection to Estella. These annoyances are moderately mitigated in large part courtesy of the charming performances of the actors, Fry and Hauser particularly outstanding. There is also the bravura work turned in by costume designer Jenny Beavan (Mad Max: Fury Road), her spectacular collection of frocks, business suits, punk jackets and casual wear arguably the films third most important character behind Estella and The Baroness. Thankfully the climax truly is wondrous, Gillespie recapturing the riotous, anything goes mania of that opening hour with stupendous aplomb. Cruella roars back to life with thunderous intensity, delivering a crowd-pleasing ending that had me wanting to rise out of my seat to cheer. I had a blast, and much like 2015s Cinderella and 2016s Petes Dragon, this is one Disney live-action remake worth getting excited about."
PHQ_Doc10_Cruella,PHQ,Comedy,Negative,Cruella,"Craig Gillespies Cruella explores the backstory of Cruella DeVille, the would-be dalmatian poacher who debuted in animated form in 1961s 101 Dalmatians and was played by Glenn Close in its 1996 live-action remake. The punningly named fashion designer goes from colorful arch villain to colorfully arch antihero in Gillespies follow-up to I, Tonya, with Emma Stone stepping into the eponymous role. Its a film that exists seemingly less because anybody has been asking for such a take on the character and more because Cruella is another intellectual property that can easily be poured into the evil-witch-turned-misunderstood-protagonist mold recently cast by Disneys Maleficent movies. But Cruellas more obvious precedent is Wicked. Like Gregory Maguires novelistic riff on Wizard of Oz and its Broadway adaptation, Gillespies film takes a monstrous character best known for her distaste for pets and other signs of bourgeois pleasantness and turns her into an animal lover shaped by a conflict with her own inhuman antagonist. The result is that Cruella, an evil-hag stereotype that beckoned camp appropriation, becomes just another nice girlthat is, relative to her nemesis, Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson), the new ur-maven of fashion cruelty in this movie universe. You may wonder how deep this rabbit hole could gowhether in 20 years well get a prequel about the Baronesss own formative bte noire. Will it turn out to be haughty, maniacal villainesses all the way down? Cruellas first act establishes the backstorys backstory: An older Cruellas voiceover accompanies the audience through a whiz-bang overview of her troubled childhood, in which her aggressive defiance of bullies both individual and institutional gets her expelled from a British private school. Its at the school where the obstreperous young Cruella, played in these scenes by Tipper Seifert-Cleveland, befriends Anita Darling (Florisa Kamara), who, implicitly because the setting is 60s Britain and shes one of the few black students at the small-town school, is able to sympathize with the outcast Cruella. To the extent that Anitas presence in the film turns out to be more than an Easter egg for those who recognize her name as belonging to the future co-owner of a certain 101 pups, its simply so the character can function to align Cruellas ostracization with the plight of the marginalized. After the magic of montage has skipped us forward a decade (much of the film plays out as a montage of scenes set to a selection of recognizable hits, mostly from the 70s), we find Cruella living by her wits as a scrappy young orphan in London. In the intervening years shes found two sidekicks to functionally replace Anita (now played by Kirby Howell-Baptiste), fellow orphans-slash-con-artists Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) and Jasper (Joel Fry). Now going exclusively by her birth name, Estella, and covering her naturally chiaroscuro coif with an auburn wig that looks an awful lot like the way Emma Stone usually wears her hair, the dognapper-in-the-making uses grift and pluck to get herself a position designing clothes at the Baronesss firm. There, a discovery about a secret in the aristocratic designers past inspires Estella to assume a dual identity, letting her alter-ego take over in a series of fashion-cum-vandalism stunts that chip away at the Baronesss fashion empire and her self-assurance. Cruella is nothing if not a film of our present moment, given how the heros flirtation with anarchy is emphasized by the flagrantly stylized depiction of her exploits. If the 70s setting and Cruellas initially grimy digs and all-consuming obsession with the Baroness recall Todd Phillipss Joker, Stones flip, diaristic voiceover (not to mention her chalk-white visage) brings to mind Cathy Yans Birds of Prey. Like Margot Robbie in the latter film, Stone relishes her role, playing Cruella as if she were headlining a burlesque show, and affecting a London-ish accent thats as artificial as a polyester boa. We hadnt stahhted yet, dahhling, she facetiously drawls during an unlikely hand-to-hand confrontation with the Baronesss goon squad. Stones performance can be fun to watch, but even her depiction of Cruellas increasing psychosis and imperiousness toward Horace and Jasper isnt enough to remove the impression that Disney is de-toothing a character whose originating motivation was the desire to murder and skin somebody elses pets. So eager to please us with sumptuous costumes and rhythmic montage, and to refresh its trademarked character by applying the same melodramatic narrative logic as countless recent properties, Cruellas outward liveliness cant mask the inner inertia it has as just another lifeless product assembled in a factory."
ADM_Doc1_Spider Man 3,ADM,Comedy,Positive,Spider Man 3,"I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome! I just saw Spider-Man 3 with my friend and while I can see why some critics have complained about some of the length and subplots, for the most part I enjoyed it. Certainly it was nice to see Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco together again as Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, and Harry Osborne. I also liked Thomas Haden Church as The Sandman and Topher Grace as, first, Peter's Bugle photo rival I heard this film is good, and it certainly impressed me! The special effects are amazing. The action scenes are so fast paced that it is sometimes hard to keep track of everything that is happening. The scenes are so well made that everything looks completely real. I particularly like how the sand moves to create the sandman. Every detail is portrayed in the film! The scene where a taxi was suspended in mid-air is thrilling and keeps me on the edge. I really liked the plot of this movie. The hilarious and yet emotional scene in the restaurant involving champagne is so entertaining! On the surface, it is a superhero story, with loads of people cheering for him on the streets. It also has elements of love, courage, friendship and loyalty. It is hard to blend all these ideas into one, and in this case they did it so well. The ending is so touching! I really liked the ending. I think the final scene could have been cut away for better pacing, but maybe for some it is necessary. Eddie Brock and then the black Spidey costume-dominated Venom. Hilarious scenes of J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Raimi regular Bruce Campbell as a French waiter who greets Peter. Nice turns from Rosemary Harris as Peter's Aunt May and Mageina Tovah as Ursala, the landlord's daughter (I first noticed her as Luke Giradi's first girlfriend, Glynis Figliola, on Joan of Arcadia). Also nice additions of James Cromwell as Captain Stacy and Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard as his daughter Gwen. And Spidey creator Stan Lee says something to Maguire that seems very poignant here. All this and some of the most thrilling scenes provided by Sam Raimi make this one of the most exciting movies of this young summer season. In other words, don't hesitate, just watch it!"
ADM_Doc2_Spider Man 3,ADM,Comedy,Positive,Spider Man 3,"Its not going to be another comment about how large complex projects have to be unimaginative for the simple reason of coordinating all the geographically dispersed teams working on bits that need to integrate. I've studied this in some detail in the film business. Its a mundane insight and I won't bore you with it. Let's just say that of all the superhero movies, this one has the most possibilities for giving us exciting dimensional vision. ""King Kong"" did it, and I saw some titillating motions in another WETA project, ""Van Helsing."" And there was some promise in the last Spiderman's fight with Ock. And its not as if dull studios can't do dimensional: just watch that first chase in ""Casino Royale."" But this is as pure a cinematic waste as I've experienced, so let's talk about why it fails and why it appears not to. Film is a matter of assembly across different worlds. There's the central world of the embodiment anchored by the actors of course, and there's the world of the cinematic cosmos, how the world works and the eye we borrow behaves in it. On these two armatures are assembled all sorts of bits that each are placed individually but that we seldom see as bits. What we are meant to see is the overall organism, the being of the thing. There are only two ways for this to emerge. Either you use convention or you rely on some coherent orchestration, usually from one mind. Here it is mere convention and why this is ordinary, even ordinarily ordinary. I've given up on Raimi, and so apparently have all his talented collaborators: Dykstra, Elfman the most obvious. He's the new Verhoeven. He's interested in events and not circumstance. Snapshots (as is Jonah Jameson) instead of story; parts instead of assemblies. Its film-making 101, this, that real film is not about independent panels like a comic book. There's motion involved. That motion has to behave in accordance with and at the same time define and illustrate the world we see and the dynamics of how we see it. Those rules of motion are negotiated over time between us and the filmmakers, and constitute an evolving vocabulary. What he have here is the cinematic equivalent of two hours or ""you know"" and other such automatic, meaningless utterances. Part of what we pay for is this game, and under normal circumstances the question we decide is whether we want sugar or meat. Here we get cardboard."
ADM_Doc3_Spider Man 3,ADM,Comedy,Positive,Spider Man 3,"Peter Parker is very happy, he's in love with the sensual Mary Jane Watson, his studies are going great, and America loves his alter ego, Spider-Man. But his world is quickly turned upside down as he comes under attack from Sandman, Goblin Jr and an alien substance that transforms Peter into something far darker than his super hero better self.

There is a school of thought that says that sequels are always the tricky films for directors to take on, that may be so in most genres, but for comic book adaptations, all films are tricky. By the time of director Sam Raimi releasing Spider-Man 3, he had not only shown the world that he clearly loved the Spider-Man characters, he showed that he also knew how to better the franchise with the second instalment. So really, if we are all honest here, it was going to take a monumental effort to not just only better parts one and two, but to merely make a film to sit alongside those finely crafted pictures as well! That he managed neither is no great surprise when watching it now after the dust has settled a few years later. In his over eagerness to entertain us the fans, and with studio interference that Raimi to date refuses to over elaborate on (Venom-AKA Eddie Brock-it was-ahem-requested he find room for), Raimi lost sight of the less is more policy that made the first two Spidey movies great.

When I first came out of the cinema after my original viewing, my head was chocked full of villains, not only that, but also Peter's love life struggles, it is in short, way too much for one movie. I had enjoyed myself for sure, hell! Raimi knows how to give his fans a good time, but when you break it own there are so many missed opportunities it grates substantially on the discerning movie watching fan. Thomas Haden Church is a fine actor, but as Marko he has little to do, so come the excellent transformation into Sandman, Church is a forgotten prop. Then there is the almost unforgivable act of losing James Franco {Goblin Jr} in amongst the collage of goings on, his Harry Osborn has a neat complexity to him and more attention to detail with this character arc would have provided great rewards I'm sure. Kirsten Dunst returns as Mary Jane but appears to be regressing in acting ability, is she bored I wonder? Or is she just not that very good an actress? The less said about Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom the better, tho in fairness Raimi never wanted the character in the film, so it's hardly surprising that the best thing about the character is the entertaining effects as Venom snarls and snaps. Bryce Dallas Howard is sparky as Gwen Stacy, and J.K. Simmons as usual owns every scene he is in.

Yet in spite of my grievances, after my HD revisit to the film I find myself warming to the Raimi franchise misfire. Clever themes such as power and its devilish off shoots are fleshed out, while the humour here is possibly the best of the three films thus far. The romantic angle between MJ and Peter is given serious thought and dare I say it, an adult make over. Whilst Tobey Maguire really has improved as an actor with each subsequent film, not withstanding an ill advised Saturday Night Fever sequence, Parker's venture to the dark side is excellently realised by Maguire. But ultimately it's with the action sequences that many younger viewers judge a Spider-Man film by, and part three is not found wanting, with a double team ultimate smack down raising the bar in gloriously over the top enjoyment. 7/10

At the time of writing the above Raimi had agreed to do Spider-Man 4, I feel sure that lessons would have been learned, as it is now, both Raimi and Maguire have left the franchise. The head honcho executives have other ideas for the next instalment......."
ADM_Doc4_Spider Man 3,ADM,Comedy,Positive,Spider Man 3,"First of all, let me say that the romantic angle is played up more so in SPIDER-MAN 3 than it was in the other Spider-Man films, which is a distinct handicap for what is primarily an action film based on the famous comic book characters.

It seems to drag noticeably in all of the quietly played scenes between TOBEY MAGUIRE and KIRSTEN DUNST, as his girlfriend May Jane whose singing career is stung by bad reviews. Then too, the scenes with ROSEMARY HARRIS, a warm and engaging actress, add to the almost soap opera flavor of the script in dealing with Spidey's human side.

But fortunately, there are enough humorous moments to atone for some of the script's shortcomings in this regard. BRUCE CAMPBELL as a French Maitre d' has a wonderful bit at the restaurant where Spidey is preparing to meet and propose to Mary Jane with a ring. And even bigger bits of humor are provided by J. K. SIMMONS as J. Jonah Jameson, the harried boss of the Daily Bugle, notably in his wonderful office scene where a diligent secretary has a novel way of reminding him to take his blood pressure pills. He's a welcome scene-stealing presence in any scene.

There's plenty of villainy going on in the guise of three chaps bent on destroying Spider-Man, the best of which is THOMAS HADEN CHURCH as the ex-convict who gets caught up in an experiment that turns him into the Sandman creature that terrorizes New York City. His transformation scenes are brilliantly done with the CGI effects outdoing themselves. He has that tough guy persona that looks just right for the role.

But the best written part for one of the three villains belongs to JAMES FRANCO who is able to convey much more of what makes Goblin II tick. He switches from affable to intense hatred with the greatest of ease and gets a lot out of the character he's playing.

Not as well scripted, but easily among the best performers in the film, is TOPHER GRACE, arrogant rival photographer at the Daily Bugle, who does a fine job as a Spider-Man adversary when he turns into Venom. Unfortunately, this comes pretty late in the film (almost as an afterthought by the writers) and he doesn't get enough time on screen to flesh out the character which would have been one of the most interesting villains if time permitted.

As it is, it all runs well over two hours and stays on a pretty smooth course throughout, for such a long film. Except for the lulls whenever Spidey deals with his romantic complications, it's a pretty fast-moving story that has some eye-filling special effects whenever things get too dull in the storytelling department.

TOBEY MAGUIRE certainly gets a chance to stretch. When his darker side takes over (and he's wearing that black suit), he shows a side of his screen personality that's been hidden in all the other Spider-Man films, and his arrogance with dance moves--while staying in character with his nerdy side--are played for laughs which are intentional.

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD makes a suitable cliff-hanging sort of heroine who can scream as well as Fay Wray (the Queen of Scream), and THERESA RUSSELL stands out in her one brief scene as Mrs. Marko.

I thoroughly enjoyed it as a blockbuster movie designed to entertain and thrill as only these Spider-Man movies can.

The CGI is remarkable for the Sandman sequences, all the production values are first class and Christopher Young's background score is a decided asset.

But, personally, I still think I preferred the other two Spider-Man films over this one."
ADM_Doc5_Spider Man 3,ADM,Comedy,Positive,Spider Man 3,"This is, Arguably, the Highlight of the Series. Many uppity Film-Critics and jaded Fanboys have Weighed in on the Weight of the Thing, but that's the Thing. This End to the Trilogy is a Darkly Heavy Conclusion and it is a Spectacular Spider-Man to say the Least.

Director Sam Raimi and the State of the Art SFX Team, and the Returning Cast are in Full Throttle for this Last Entry in Their Series. It's like in the Early Years of its Silver Age Comics when the Monthly Titles were 12 cents and then there was that anticipated OverSized Annual, Costing a Whopping 25 cents. Excelsior!

This is Oversized and it Cost More to make. While that can Signal Trouble, Not So for this Power-Packed Picture. It is Edgier too. A Tale from a Director who Knows Dark and Edgy and Sam Raimi Lets Fly with All He's Got. Spidey. Goblin, Venom, and Sandman have Battle Scenes that are so Fantastic that they Literally Set the Bar for this Type of Thing.

The Movie Exudes Excellence from the Get-Go. It's a Non-Stop array of Births, Transformations, and shifting Personas and Allegiances that are Bizarre, Befitting its Comic-Book Roots. This one is more Gritty than the Previous Films, with some Horrific Undertones. But also Included is some Black Comedy that Lightens the Mood, but Not for Long.

Other returning Characters are here for Continuity. Of Course there's Mary Jane who provides a Love Triangle with Tragic Consequences and a Twist, J. Jonah Jameson, Aunt May, and this jam Packed Extravaganza also Introduces Gwen Stacey.

There's as much here and More than anyone Could Expect and this Extraordinary Movie is Bursting with Bravado, and Sentimentality. An Underrated Comic-Book Movie that is Exceptional Entertainment and perhaps Over Time when this First Wave of Super-Hero Movies are Not Taken so much For Granted, its Reputation and Radiance will become more Appreciated. Nuff Said. My favourite of the three Tobey Maguire Spider Man movies. More character depth than the other two, more complexity in the plot. Visual effects also seemed better.

I particularly liked it when Spider-Man became Bad Spidey - was quite amusing and cool and made me wish Spider-Man was like that all the time! A whole movie of Bad Spidey would be fantastic. I actually laughed when I was meant to(and quite a few times where I wasn't). I wouldn't object to every single frame that contains singing and dancing in this to be excised, and possibly torched. The action is engaging and cool. I never found Maguire threatening. The added characters are underused, not developed enough and kind of a waste of a lot of fantastic comic material. Like the second flick, this didn't have a finished script ready when production began, and oh boy did it show this time. They managed to work it out on that sequel, not with this one. It still looks excellent. The effects are astounding. There are memorable sequences in this. The cast is all great. Grace obviously doesn't make an impressive, well, if you should know what he plays, you probably already do, so to avoid spoilers, I won't put it here. I get why they gave him the role, and his performance isn't ""poor"", as such. It's unfortunate that the decision was made to jam so much into this one, when it could be better if split up. All in all, this is entertaining, if not as dramatic and epic as it would like to be. There are several featurettes, most of which I will review at their respective entries on this site, photo galleries, trailers(for this and other flicks), a music video and two commentary tracks, a Raimi & actors one, and a film-makers(producers) one. I recommend this to those looking for a fun follow-up to the first two, that tries for, and generally succeeds reasonably at, being as deep and interesting."
ADM_Doc6_Spider Man 3,ADM,Comedy,Negative,Spider Man 3,"Ah, the Spider-Man film that nearly ruined the franchise, Spider-Man 3. Like the previous two films, there's a tremendous amount of nostalgia attached to this film for me. This was the first trilogy of superhero films that I connected with, and at 13 years-old I was willing to forgive many of the mistakes this film made, most of which I cannot forgive a decade later. Only a few films have tried balancing more than one villain, Spider-Man 3 being the classic example of how not to do it. Apparently, the studio forced Venom on Sam Raimi and hence making Harry & Sandman's arc far less effective when the final act is bogged down by a silly attempt at bringing Venom to the big screen. None of the three villains are all that great, but there's at least some emotional undercurrent with both Sandman and Harry. Venom is, more or less, just a third act reveal that is meant to please fans. Only, it did the exact opposite. Another thing that definitely didn't win over fans was the fact that this film made Peter Parker an absolute jerk. It's one thing to have the symbiote change Peter, but it's another thing to have him physically abuse Mary Jane, and nearly kill his best friend Harry multiple times. This was far from the Peter Parker we came to love in the first two films. Another headache was the direction they took Harry Osborn. Having him get ""hit in the head"" and lose his memory for half the film was one of the stupidest and laziest decisions I can remember from a comic-book film. I don't mind having Harry go the villainous route, but the memory loss was all a bit of a headache. There is good, however. Raimi, as he proved in the first two, is great at shooting high-scale action. The CGI is definitely dated when looking back on it after 10 years, but the action is as visceral as anything in any Spider-Man film to date. Yes, that includes 'Homecoming'. If only the dialogue surrounding the action could match the brutality. I also think Thomas Haden-Church's performance as Sandman is nothing to scoff at, reminding me of the character depth that made Doc Ock so memorable. At the end of the day, Raimi was trying to give us a Spider-Man film that dealt with bigger and more important personal issues, whether that worked for you or not is entirely up to the viewer. I think if Raimi had the tools that filmmakers have now (improved CGI) and perhaps a little less studio interference, then Spider-Man 3 could be a much better end to the trilogy than it ended up being. There's plenty I can't forgive about this film, especially the infamous 'dancing in the street' sequence, but I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as people make it out to be. +Action +Deals with real issues -But is sometimes careless in its execution -3 villains proved to be way too much -Memory loss for Harry ."
ADM_Doc7_Spider Man 3,ADM,Comedy,Negative,Spider Man 3,"I have something of a love-hate relationship with this movie. Each time I see it, my opinion differs. First viewing, I hated it; then it grew on me; then it would lose me. This timeI didn't like it. Look, there's good stuff in here, great stuff even. The Sandman born sequence is amazing, and some of the action scenes hold up. But amnesia Harry, emo Peter, and the stupid miscommunications on which the whole plot is built make a lot of it pretty insufferable."
ADM_Doc8_Spider Man 3,ADM,Comedy,Negative,Spider Man 3,"""Spider-Man 3"" wasn't so much a letdown as it was a massive disappointment. A movie that was so preoccupied with the effects budget that the filmmakers forgot to cook up a decent script. I wanted to see if five years' passage would improve my outlook on the film, but it's still just as aggravating as it was in May of 2007.

For starters, the movie suffers from too many bad guys. And none of them are in Doctor Octopus' league. Harry Osborn's still super miffed at Peter Parker for killing his father (even though he didn't), and has taken up Norman's mantle as some sort of misguided Green Goblin 2. At the same time, a freak accident turns escaped con Flint Marko into the Sandman - pretty much the granulated equivalent of Robert Patrick's T-1000. He doesn't have a beef with Peter, but he does need convenient bank job money to afford health care for his sick kid (and Spidey naturally stands in his way). Peter is also dealing with anxiety over proposing to Mary Jane (whom he's fought tooth and nail for two movies to win over). That seems enough for a movie, doesn't it?

Nope, needs more.

A sticky black substance plummets to Earth, finds its way to Peter's apartment and bonds to his skin. Turns out it's an alien symbiote using Peter as a host organism. Good news is it makes Peter more powerful. The downside is it also makes him a bit of a douche. So Peter finally manages to get this thing off of him, where it finds another host; this time, it's Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), the new photog at the Daily Bugle. Brock's relationship with the symbiote manifests itself in blind rage, and we have our third villain: Venom.

The villain congestion underlines a major problem with the screenplay: Sandman's the only character that feels like he got a full showcase as bad guy. Venom and Harry are treated as momentary distractions where they feel like they could've carried a lot more of this thing. And the black costume was a pretty major storyline in the comic. But here, he's in possession all of 20 minutes' story time. It's symptomatic of too many cooks getting short shrift in the kitchen.

And that is precisely what is so infuriating about Spider-Man 3: the script. One that comes as not only lazy, but altogether cheap. Take Harry's character arc, for instance:

1. Harry and Peter have a knock-down drag-out fight, Harry suffers head trauma and forgets he was ever mad at Peter. 2. Harry suddenly hears his admonishing father in his head, remembers why he was out to kill Peter, and now he's evil again (more fighting) 3. The butler (who wasn't even there in the last two movies) conveniently shows up and lays it all out for Harry. Dad was the bad guy, not Spider-Man! You've had him all wrong all along! 4. Harry sees the light and proceeds to help Peter fight the Sandman and Venom.

But wait, there's more ...

Peter and Aunt May are told by the police that the guy they thought killed Uncle Ben in the first movie was only an accomplice. The real killer was actually ... wait for it ... Flint Marko!

I'll admit, it's a pet peeve of mine to see this brand of retcon. It's smacks of laziness, and it's dismissive of the audience's intelligence. I get it - they needed to give Peter an emotional reason to go after the Sandman. But even kidnapping his girlfriend (though it's been done before) is more ingenuous than this. Or Marko could kill Harry, and that might give Peter a reason to grow annoyed.

What's mystifying about ""Spider-Man 3"" is witnessing just how many things went wrong, compared to just how many they got right with the previous movie. ""Spider-Man 3"" has too many villains, subplots and bad writing to be anything other than background noise when you're washing the dishes. Or, when you've lost the remote, and can't shake your vegetable torpor to get up and change the channel. It's not ""Superman 3"" bad, but it's not good.

Not good, at all."
ADM_Doc9_Spider Man 3,ADM,Comedy,Negative,Spider Man 3,"Yes, I am aware Spider-Man comes from the comic books. And I've read enough of them that the word ""meanwhile"" shows up quite often. Unfortunately, they didn't place ""meanwhile"" in Spider-Man 3.

I don't know how many subplots are in Spider-Man 3, but I'll try to list them. All. And with the appropriate word ""meanwhile"" to transition them, as they should've in the movie:

Mary Jane's finally on Broadway. Meanwhile, Harry's still seeking revenge on Spider-Man for the supposed murder of his father, a.k.a. Green Goblin. Meanwhile, Peter wants to marry MJ. Meanwhile, an alien force lands on Earth. Meanwhile, Flint, related to the death of Uncle Ben, breaks out of prison. Meanwhile, Flint's fighting to make his sick daughter alive and his ex at bay. Meanwhile, Harry gets temporary amnesia. Meanwhile, Brock is yearning to be Spidey's new press agent. Meanwhile, Gwen is dangerously modeling during an accident and Spidey rescues her. Meanwhile, her father, the police captain, grants Spidey the key to the city. Meanwhile, MJ gets fired for bad acting. Meanwhile, Peter proposes and gets turned down from MJ. Meanwhile, romance sparks up between MJ and Harry. Meanwhile, Sandman and Spidey fight. Meanwhile, the black goo, a.k.a. alien Venom attaches to Spidey. Meanwhile, Spidey gets loose and becomes a real person, albeit aggressive. Meanwhile, Spidey loses the Venom to Brock. Meanwhile, Brock becomes a cartoon black Spidey. Meanwhile, Harry's father's ghost visits and convinces him to blackmail MJ and fight Spidey. Meanwhile, Sandman and Venom team up to hurt Spidey. Meanwhile, Peter makes MJ jealous with Gwen. Meanwhile, Dr. Connors warns of the black goo. Meanwhile, Peter's apartment manager, daughter and Aunt gives good advice while either criticizing his place or again, asking for rent. Meanwhile, J. Jonah Jameson is having pill problems. Meanwhile, Peter learns to dance, horribly, but it was meant for comic relief, I suppose. Meanwhile, the ""Alfred""-butler reveals at the most opportune time what Harry needed to hear to move the plot along.

(That last one made me actually crack up in the theatre  Seriously? He chose that moment after 3 movies to reveal the truth behind the death of the Green Goblin?)

Wow. Did I miss any? I understand that's not entirely in order and that's not all of the multiple subplots, but I count twenty-six subplots. Twenty-six??? Seriously? This has to be a record.

I've seen this movie a few times, and though it's not horrible, in fact it's decently filmed and Grace brings a lot to his role as Brock/Venom, there are way too many things going on. It certainly had the ""Batman"" dilemma. By the time the original Batman series got to part IV, there were so many villains, so many characters, so many subplots, it was so bogged down, it was unwatchable. And that's sad. This could've been so much better if they focused on only Venom as a villain. Or just Sandman as a villain. Or signaling out Gwen as a love interest. Or even Spidey going bad. Or the now-age-old New Goblin as a rival.

No, they had to put 26+ ideas in one. The biggest problem with the entire series is pacing. Going on way too long. Here, in part III, they not only decided to actually increase the length, but add way too many ideas.

Unfortunately, that was the movie's undoing. Despite some awesome action sequences (Harry Vs. Peter in the opening and the absolute comic-book ending fight) the movie seriously should be skipped. I remember watching this in theatres thinking: ""Oh, I can't wait to watch this on DVD, so I can just skip to the 30 minutes (of 139) that I actually liked.""

Speaking of which, I'm guessing we're not supposed to side with aggressive Spider-Man, made that way with the alien goo. Unlike the other Super-Hero Part 3, where Kal-El goes bad in Superman III, I actually liked Peter/Black-Spidey much better than the red/blue good-guy. At least this Dark-Spidey got paid for once.

Let's hope they get back on track for part IV. Ideas: go back to one villain. Lose the ""love conflict story"" between the two leads  Oh My God, that's been played out for almost seven hours of the series. In addition, if there is a wedding, yeah, like there won't be, make it quick and get back to the action. And, finally, fire Willem Dafoe  enough with the Green Goblin!!!!"
ADM_Doc10_Spider Man 3,ADM,Comedy,Negative,Spider Man 3,"""Spider-Man 3"" is a very disappointing conclusion to the Spider-Man trilogy. It's poorly written: bloated, episodic, repetitive and, yet, sill manages to leave some matters unexplained or unresolved. In the beginning, it feels as though it were merely a victory lap for the filmmakers after the first two movies, with Manhattan celebrating Spiderman and awarding him with the Key to the City. There's some manufactured drama for Peter and Mary Jane's relationship revolving around her supposedly-newfound inability to act. I mean, wasn't that obvious after each time we saw her perform in ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" in ""Spider-Man 2"" she flubbed her lines. Now, she's obviously lip syncing songs. I'm not surprised she's fired. Anyways, the screenplay, perhaps, could've done something interesting with the notion of Spidey being a more-successful performer in his heroism than Mary Jane is with her acting on stage, but that whole thread is basically abandoned by the end of the movie.

Instead, we get more of Green Goblin Jr. and that love triangle/revenge storyline. Plus, Spidey gets two more supervillains on top of that. The Sandman puts me to sleep. I almost didn't notice that his storyline is never resolved. So what of his daughter, then? And Venom seems monotonous since we just saw Peter fighting the same virus off himself after it had turned him--laughably--emo. Moreover, how does Venom know about the Sandman and his daughter and so seek him out in the first place? And, come to think of it, why does Venom--seemingly knowingly--call Spidey by the same pet name, ""tiger,"" that Mary Jane used last movie? Or how convenient is it that the butler finally tells Harry what he should've told him two movies ago? This thing needed more rewrites, to clear the cobwebs away.

Third and by far the weakest in the famed ""Spider-Man"" trilogy falls way short due to characters that have apparently run their depth course, hully-gully direction by co-writer Sam Raimi, and a running time that goes way beyond the outer limits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) seems to have everything going his way. His girlfriend (Kirsten Dunst) now knows he truly is the titled character and they are about to be wed. Plus her aspirations as a serious stage actress seem to be becoming reality while his college career continues to take flight. However, there are evil forces that loom in seemingly every direction. James Franco is back and still seeking revenge on his father's death which occurred at the conclusion of the original. An escaped convict (Thomas Haden Church), who might have had something to do with Maguire's uncle's death, has become some strange sort of super-villain after a strange accident that gives the character human/sand-like powers. Then we have an upstart cameraman (Topher Grace) who wants to steal Maguire's spotlight at work, and finally a strange cosmic black substance that attaches itself to entities of rage. Still with me? ""Spider-Man 3"" comes with too much baggage. The first two were heavy enough as they were, but this one is way too cute and smart for its own good. Too many side-stories, too many black and white characteristics of the major players and too many special effects-laden sequences that dull rather than excite cause this movie to be a gigantic bore of near epic proportions. It is saying a lot when B-movie ham Bruce Campbell, with his typical cameo, ends up being the most interesting and intriguing part of the whole flimsy production. 2.5 out of 5 stars."
AAY_Doc1_FrozenII,AAY,Comedy,Negative,Frozen II,"Three weeks after Donald Trump was elected president I went to see Disneys Moana. It made me smile for the first time since the election and cry for the hundredth. A few months later, I came out as trans and the movies power ballad, How Far Ill Go became my private little trans anthem. There was something about the simplicity of a Disney I want song that captured my intense feelings.
But the voice inside sings a different song/What is wrong with me?
Im certainly not the first queer person to project their coming out onto a Disney musical. Some people watched Pinocchio and wished to be a real boy. Others watched The Little Mermaid and longed to be part of that world. Many, many watched Mulan and wondered when their reflection would show who they were inside.
But none of these movies, not Moana, not even Mulan, elicited the same queer uproar as Frozen. By 2013, the possibility of a gay Disney movie didnt feel as far-fetched as it might have ten years prior. Mainstream LGBTQ+ acceptance was moving at a rapid pace, at least when it came to palatable queerness, and what was more palatable than a white cis femme snow queen?
While certainly unintended by its straight co-directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, and its straight co-songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, Frozen works remarkably well as a queer allegory. Its power is not simply that Elsa reads as queer. Its the specificity of her queerness, and her struggles with that queerness, that really make it sing.
Dont let them in, dont let them see/Be the good girl you always have to be
Frozen is not about Elsa falling in love with another woman. And its not just about her feeling different and learning to accept that difference. What Frozen is really about is the guilt queer people feel when coming out  the feeling that being ourselves will hurt the ones we love most. Elsa and her sister Anna make me think about my own family members that told me again and again how hard my coming out was on them. When I watch the sisters hug at the end of the movie I feel a possibility for healing  the stuff of fairy tales, but comforting all the same.
I didnt expect Frozen 2 to give Elsa a girlfriend, despite the widespread internet campaign. I was far more worried that the perfect allegory of the first film would be ruined with the opposite. I was worried theyd give her a boyfriend. Thankfully the sequel did not make that misstep, but it makes another thats more complicated, and, in its own way, equally painful. It doesnt erase the magic of its predecessor, but it strips itself of its own potential.
If Disney wasnt ready to explicitly represent a fifth of its young audience, they couldve at least given Elsa a gal pal. I dont need to see Elsa make out with the mysterious voice calling her to the next chapter of queer life, but lord did it have to be her mother?
The plot of the sequel is both convoluted and familiar. Elsa is feeling another swirling storm inside and unleashes the power of the nearby enchanted forest. It was closed for decades  ever since her father narrowly escaped as a teen after a mysterious disaster. With the magic forces freed, Arendelle has become unlivable, and Elsa, along with Anna, her boyfriend Kristoff, his reindeer Sven, and their snowman Olaf, must venture into the mystery. Elsa must follow the voice.
Are you someone out there whos a bit like me?/Who knows deep down Im not where Im meant to be?
The enchanted forest allows for some truly stunning animation, and the introduction of creatures that Im sure have already been turned into toys. But the emotional beats of the forest often feel hollow. Annas insistence on following her sister lacks the motivation of the original film, instead reading as a foolish death wish. She knows she lacks Elsas powers, so why doesnt she realize her presence is simply a burden? Allegorically, why is Anna trying to tag along with her sister to the gay bar?
But, of course, this isnt the allegory at play. When Elsa finally does discover the voice, its not a coded lover  someone a bit like her  but instead the spirit of her mother. This is made especially painful by the incredibly gay lyrics in her dead mom duet.
Are you the one Ive been looking for/All my life?
Elsas mother reveals why shes been calling her daughter to this land  and reveals the actual allegory. The inhabitants of the forest are coded as Indigenous and Arendelle was responsible for the destruction of their land. Elsas mother reveals that she was one of these Indigenous people but she rescued Elsas father out of love. Theres a moment where it seems like the movie might be making an interesting point about reckoning with a colonial past, but then Elsa finds a way to save the forest and Arendelle, and any strength in the metaphor is removed. A statue is erected to commemorate their parents love, a painfully reductive celebration of people coming together. The films take on colonialism ends up being as morally complex as Disneys Pocahontas. Ultimately, this becomes the films most abhorrent misstep, beyond its disappointing approach to queerness.
What made Frozen special as a queer allegory is it didnt require a double consciousness. Unlike other very-gay-not-gay movies, there are no scenes in Frozen that have to be ignored; no moment where Elsa is forced to engage in compulsory heterosexuality. You can enjoy the movie from beginning to end with your whole gay heart. But Frozen 2 does not allow that. Instead you have to parse through the complicated mess that is Elsa having queer longings for her mother.
This isnt to say Frozen 2 is without its pleasures. The soundtrack really is phenomenal, as is the animation. The world thats built is a joy to watch and the script is filled with a lot of fun humor. The movie also contains a thread of environmentalism that works much better than its attempts at portraying colonization. But despite these strengths, the movie just made me feel sad. When Kristoff proposes to Anna near the end of the film, I felt its message deep within me: queer children still dont get a love story.
Maybe someday well finally see the movie we deserve  a queer Disney musical that loves us back. But until then Ill listen to the Frozen 2 soundtrack and imagine it was supported by a movie with even a single snowflake of moral courage."
AAY_Doc2_FrozenII,AAY,Comedy,Negative,Frozen II,"Chris Buck and Jennifer Lees follow-up to their phenomenal ice-maiden animation takes on the weight of ecological tragedy with ravishing technique, but loses the human spark.
What comes after happily ever after? Disney animated features based on fairytales dont usually get theatrical sequels. But the $1.3 billion commercial and cultural phenomenon that was Frozen (2013) replaced passive princely rescue with fierce girl power. So its no surprise to find this visually spectacular, dark-themed sequel reaching beyond happy-ending tropes to turn fairytale into epic.
Drawn north by a siren voice to save the kingdom of Arendelle from attack by mysterious forces based in the Enchanted Forest, outsider Elsa is this time a Tolkien-for-tinies questing heroine, rather than a rogue snow queen. Plunging into ferocious conflicts with the nature-wrapped and nebulous element spirits, as she wrestles a swooping tornado or ices a roaring wildfire or flood, she becomes an increasingly mythic figure.
These big battles demand outsize soundtrack bangers, but Idina Menzel/Elsas Let It Go-style empowerment ballads Into the Unknown and Show Yourself strain uncomfortably for anthemic status. Now a sparkly dressed, song-powered superhero, Elsa works towards the kind of kingdom-saving transformation that hints at the influence of the Marvel Universe on that of Hans Christian Andersen.
Directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee have plundered Norse myths and Sami folk tales (and the 1950s Disney forest paintings of Eyvind Earle) to create lavish autumnal settings for forest battles and waterfall plunges. Theres a Studio Ghibli vibe, too, in the films animist content, and its Princess Mononoke-ish struggle to rebalance humans and nature, as gorgeously rendered gales, conflagrations and sea storms sweep angrily across the screen. Less happily, this is spliced with an overcomplicated narrative, ranging across key childhood flashbacks, loose Frozen plot threads and damning royal-family revelations. These last are received via intricate ice sculptures, which resemble Carnival Cruise buffet centrepieces more than magically conjured insights.
Combined with Frozen IIs weightier themes (colonialism, wronged indigenous tribes, reparation) and overarching climate-change allegory, its pretty dark stuff. Racked by her inability to protect Elsa, sister Anna is left sidelined, her boyfriend Kristoffs failed marriage proposals levered in as light relief. Jonathan Groff/Kristoffs 1990s boy-band spoof song Lost in the Woods, complete with reindeer chorus, provides three minutes of uncomplicated pleasure. As does Olafs idiot-savant snowman; Josh Gads wisecracking voice work and hilarious ten-second recreation of the Frozen plot make him the films standout performance.
However, neither they nor a Bambis-mother-sized tragic moment can prevent the narrative feeling worthy and a bit generic, despite the eye-popping staging of Elsas titanic sea battle with a rearing, spectral-horse water spirit. The films obsession with big themes and its lack of meaty characters / villains / twists to carry them reduce it to handsome, ravishingly animated spectacle. Shorter on the character, charm and heart that marked out Frozen, the sequel cant give its high drama the same emotional intensity. Its suffering from superhero syndrome: when comic-book epics dominate the box office, they also colonise Hollywood creativity. Supersizing Frozen II to create a battle-packed origin story suggests that Disneys question this time was: Do you wanna build a franchise?"
AAY_Doc3_FrozenII,AAY,Comedy,Negative,Frozen II,"We have seen it thousands of times in our lives but it has never felt more menacing than it does now. 
I am speaking of the digital version of the Disney logo, in which the camera swoops down from Cinderellas castle, roaming over river and dale like a hungry vulture. It runs before the start of Frozen 2, the forthcoming box office behemoth that will be holding the companys water until the next oneStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalkerdebuts in a month.
What for much of our lives felt like an invitation to magical wonder, in the days following the Disney+ takeover of our streaming habits, registers more like a declaration of lands conquered as well as something of an implied threat. The House of Mouse has long controlled our childhoods, our imaginations, our imaginations of childhood, and our debit cards. What could possibly be next?
After spending most of its existence convincing young women that someday their prince will come, Disney made an off-brand yet largely successful play for womens empowerment with 2013s Frozen. With that films inevitable sequel, the filmmakersreturning directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, working from a script by Lee, who also serves as the Chief Creative Officer of Walt Disney Animation Studiosseem less interested in the easily meme-able and hummable girl power that made the first film so meaningful for so many.
Instead, they have chosen to commit themselves to a rather complicated if not particularly memorable story that revolves around the sins of the lead characters grandparents. The overstuffed tale, structured Tolkien-like as a perilous quest by a party of adventurers, involves a 35-year-old infrastructure project, an enchanted forest sealed off from the rest of the world by an impenetrable fog, and a mysterious voice that keeps the headstrong ice queen Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) perpetually distracted as if shes getting texts throughout the whole movie. 
Both the songs (once again written by two-time Oscar-winners Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez) and the relationships between the charactersstrong points of the original filmregister with less energy and originality this time around.
Yes, the most dynamic pairing is the sisters; unfortunately, all the energy flows entirely in one direction. Anna (Kristen Bell) is obsessed with the well-being of Elsa, whose mind is on the more pressing matter of calming the nature spirits threatening to lay waste to Arendelle. The problem is so pronounced that Anna is unable to notice the absolute devotion expressed towards her by Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). Annas dedication towards her sister is less admirable than it is an adult manifestation of childhood trauma that is keeping her from moving forward; it requires less a splashy song than some serious time on the therapists couch.
The silken-voiced Groff gets a sensitive power ballad in Lost in the Wood, a sequence presented in the style of an early 90s hair band video. This meta joke, more fitting in style with the humor of Dreamworks Animation movies, played gangbusters in the crowded movie theater where I saw the film, though it was hard to tell if at least some of the cheesiness people were laughing at in the clich-ridden song was unintentional. Mendel, one of the defining Broadway voices of our time, shows the ability to go from throat-lozenge slick to fire hose powerful with barely an upshift, letting it go to great effect with Into the Great Unknown.
The problem is that, while the visuals sometimes have stunning beauty and motion, there is little on screen or in the soundtrack that feels truly unknown, or carries any of the freshness of the snow that covers Elsas kingdom. Thats not to say that there arent a few surprises: Josh Gads Olaf is emotionally adroit and full of fast changes and unexpected beats. Gad, who adds comic spark to the otherwise pedestrian When I Am Older, has helped give life to a character whose steadfastness and open-hearted vulnerability has made him a worthy comedy successor to Burt Lahrs Cowardly Lion.
Its just that the world that surrounds the sentient snowman feels all too familiar, and the ideas expressed in the film are intended to fulfill built-in expectations rather than challenge us or buck long-held princess film conventions the way the first movie did so memorably. As a result, Frozen 2 has no special message to impart beyond the obvious: its Disneys woodsand were just lost in them."
AAY_Doc4_FrozenII,AAY,Comedy,Negative,Frozen II,"Two thoughts occurred while watching the sequel to Frozen. First: Man, the field of computer animation has come a long way when it comes to depicting water. Every drop of H2O here  and there is a lot of it, in the form of rippling and then rushing rivers, towering tidal waves, pelting rain, and all the chilled equivalents  looks exactly like the aqua of our world. However much money was deemed necessary to spend on perfecting the art of animating water to such photorealistic perfection, it was well-budgeted and spent. I could watch the background environmental action here for hours. But then the second thought of my Frozen 2 experience hit: I really wish I was listening to Let it Go right now.
For all the many millions of dollars thrown at Frozen 2?s next-generation computer animation, and the many millions more devoted to the films various artisans and voice performers and musicians, the new film simply doesnt sing. Not, at least, like its predecessor, which arrived in 2013 as a curiosity if not outright annoyance (a non-Pixar Disney film? Pfffft) and left that same year as a cultural typhoon wherein not one inch of the culture was safe from domination. Whatever cinematic alchemy enriched the original Frozen to such delirious heights  from the playful animation to Idina Menzels to-the-rafters rendition of Let it Go  has been since crystallized in time, never to be thawed. So returning co-directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck make do with what, only a decade ago, might be considered decent enough material to warrant a direct-to-video sequel  la The Lion King 1 1/2 or Aladdin 2: The Return of Jaffar.
The new film opens three years after the events of the first, with the superpowered Elsa (Menzel) happily if warily ruling over the wintry kingdom of Arendelle, her loyal sister Anna (Kristen Bell) by her side and still courting lovable everyman Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). Everything seems fine and frolic-y until Elsa starts hearing a mysterious siren call coming from the nearby woods, which have remain unexplored for decades due to narrative convenience. This leads the sisters, Kristoff and their crew of comic-relief things-that-shouldnt-emote-but-do  including reindeer Sven and snowman Olaf, the latter of whom is again voiced by Josh Gad and whose tenor acts as a Pavlovian prompt for parents to discreetly insert their AirPods  on a journey to uncover the origin of Elsas magic, and the dark history of Arendelle.
Theres a challenging chestnut of an idea resting inside the main story line, pivoting on Lee and Bucks desire to explore postcolonial politics and the erasure of Indigenous culture. Arendelle, you see, has only thrived because Elsa and Annas grandfather (spoiler-alert, for those who dont know how screenplays work) betrayed the trust of the areas Indigenous people. But the filmmakers potentially interesting thematic interests are slathered in slow, prosaic storytelling. Not to mention an eventual undermining of whatever good cultural intentions Frozen 2 had, given that the film is obviously more interested in ensuring Elsa, Anna and the other modern-day Arendellians come out of the mess guilt-free than anything involving, say, actual accountability. None of this should be surprising  this is reconciliation by way of Disney, sanded down and squeaky clean. What actually takes the wind out of Frozen 2?s many attempts at epic gust is its repeated failure to imagine and entertain.
Elsa, Anna and the rest of Arendelles heroes dont seem to have evolved much from the final minutes of the first film. The animation has been upgraded on a technical level  again, so much pretty water  but the enchanted forest near Arendelle feels conjured by any school-aged child with a half-decent imagination. Returning composers Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez attempt mightily to leap over the musical highs of Let it Go, but the necessary majesty just isnt there in the obvious new contenders Into the Unknown and Show Yourself. And if anyone thought that the 2017 short film Olafs Frozen Adventure pointed to an overexposure of that particular character, then Frozen 2?s many snowman-centric moments will make you pray for global warming.
So Frozen 2 mostly ends up as a cash-grab. But thanks to its brand legacy and the sheer might of Disney, youll likely be handing that cash over regardless. Make it hard. And cold."
AAY_Doc5_FrozenII,AAY,Comedy,Negative,Frozen II,"Elsa does not get a girlfriend in Frozen II, with condolences to the fans who pleaded to Disney for one, like supplicants petitioning an indifferent corporate god. The frosty former princess does, however, get a magical horse, and its pretty sick. It is, technically, a water spirit called a Nokk, but what matters is that its crystalline and capable of galloping across the surface of the ocean in a way that both looks cool and makes Elsas silver hair, unleashed from its braid, flutter aspirationally in the wind. Thats the kind of sight that you can imagine making a childs heart explode with covetous delight, especially one of the little girls who were key to making the first Frozen a beast of a $1.27 billion global hit in 2013, and who pushed its breakout ballad Let It Go into brain-melting inescapability.
Frozen II is, like its predecessor, a kids movie, but its also, like its predecessor, an official Walt Disney Animation Studios release, which means its a vector for merchandise, music, theme-park rides, eventual remakes, and a young generations pop cultural pressure points. There is every possibility that Into the Unknown  the new designated banger from songwriting team Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, featuring the same sort of soaring chorus and the same high note as Let It Go  will become aural wallpaper in the houses and vehicles of families around the world. The tendency people have developed to talk about these movies as bearing a public responsibility is both a symptom of our disturbingly parasocial relationship with a massive media conglomerate, and an acknowledgment of that massive media conglomerates awesome reach and influence. Disney doles out its milestones of representation in intensely calculated dribs and drabs. Itll only give one of its princesses more than an exclusively gay moment once its sure it can maximize plaudits for its progressiveness while preserving its bottom line in more repressive international regions.
Its easier to think about Frozen II as a product than as a film because a (sometimes stunning-looking) product is all that it feels like. It was directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, the team behind the first film, from a script that Lee wrote, and that never really pretends that it exists because the story, rather than the market, demanded more. That story has the feel of the kind of invented errand that used to fuel countless direct-to-video sequels, only this ones been blown up to a grand scale, with accompanying sumptuous production values. Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) is now queen of the hygge-heavy kingdom of Arendelle, though shes distracted by a haunting call that only she can seem to hear. Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), still accompanied by his reindeer, Sven, is working his way up to proposing to Elsas sister, Anna (Kristen Bell). Then theres the snowman. There is, I regret to inform you, an awful lot of the snowman, Olaf (Josh Gad), which, alongside Elsas ascendance to lead, indicates that some fan demands were heeded.
The group hauls off to the north in order to save Arendelle from a plot device, finding their way to an enchanted forest thats home to the Smi-inspired Northuldra tribe. The Northuldra, led by Yelana (Martha Plimpton), have a fraught history with Arendelle, once approached as allies until something went wrong and the area was sealed off by mist. The mystery behind these events will turn out to involve the colonialist ambitions of a past king and a betrayal that reveals that illustrious ancestors are rarely all theyre idealized to be  ambitious stuff from the company that made Pocahontas, though the inevitable happy resolution suggests that these films still arent exactly up to reckoning with restitutions for inherited trauma. That mystery, anyway, becomes intertwined with a journey of self-discovery involving an explanation for Elsas powers, and while that resolves in a sequence that Im still not entirely sure I understand, it does manage to once again gift the character with a gleaming new outfit.
Its hard not to feel jaded about Frozen II, while also understanding that those feelings dont matter at all, and that the film is going to go on to draw huge audiences heavy on children and accompanying parents wholl appreciate being thrown a bone by way of Kristoffs amusingly 80s-rock-inflected number. The film comes from a tradition that has spawned both incredible classics of animated artistry and overtly calculating entertainments, and it happens to skew more toward the latter. Its carefully modulated to reach the widest possible audience while offering just enough for the adults in the room to shrug and think, Hey, at least these are strong female characters, right? And the thing is that, even as a mostly mercenary endeavor, the movie is still capable of moments of astonishing beauty. Take, for instance, the sequence in which Elsa attempts to cross a stormy sea, trying and failing to use ice to crest the raging waves. Its in those waters that she battles the Nokk, eventually finding a way to get on its back and ride away triumphant. Adult me knows that thing is already available in toy stores, but child me would have died to have one."
AAY_Doc6_FrozenII,AAY,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II,"Six years have passed since the first Frozen hit theaters  a long time by any standard, but especially so for its target audience of kiddos and the parents. The fans returning for Frozen 2 in 2019 aren't the same people they were in 2013. They're older and wiser, with new interests and new worries. And in Frozen 2, they'll find a sequel that's tried to grow up along with them.
Granted, it's still PG-rated stuff. Although Frozen 2 explores some fairly heavy themes, it does so lightly enough to remain accessible to younger viewers. It retains so many of the likable elements that made the first Frozen into a smash hit: Winning characters, silly jokes (many of them courtesy of the perpetually childlike Olaf), and catchy tunes.
But whereas the first film played on familiar ideas about the power of friendship and the importance of being oneself, the sequel touches upon concerns that aren't so easily smoothed away. Olaf (Josh Gad) is alternatively excited and anxious about the prospect of getting older. Anna (Kristen Bell) struggles to do the right thing when all seems lost. Elsa (Idina Menzel) uncovers troubling secrets about Arendelle's past, a la Thor: Ragnarok and Maleficent: Mistress of Evil. And Kristoff (Jonathan Groff)... is also there, providing moral support to all the others. Well, at least he gets a hilarious '80s ballad this time.
The film opens by introducing the complicated lore that will propel the rest of the plot. A flashback reveals that decades ago, the Arendellians went to meet the Northudra, their magic-wielding neighbors, in an enchanted forest. A skirmish broke out, an impenetrable mist settled over the wood, and no one has managed to come in or out of it ever since.
That's the short summary. The full version involves supernatural visions and elemental spirits and possibly a mythical island that holds the key to everything. It's a much more fantastical addition to the Frozen universe  to the extent that, were it not for the presence of known characters like Anna and Elsa, it would be hard to tell at all this was a Frozen movie. Directors Jennifer Lee (who also wrote the screenplay) and Chris Buck have promised that Frozen 2 would answer questions left lingering by the first Frozen, but what they've delivered feels more like a series of answers to questions we didn't even know to ask, and that raise more questions still.
All of this  the expanded mythology, the more mature themes  proves too much for Frozen 2 to handle in its 103-minute run time, especially since it also needs to make room for extravagant musical numbers (there are three in the first 20 minutes alone) and dramatic action sequences. The logic crumbles under close scrutiny, and so do the themes they're meant to explore. Meanwhile, some of the most intriguing elements of this movie, like Northuldra characters Ryder and Honeymaren, are relegated to the sidelines to make room for our heroes to do their thing.
But those turn out to be relatively minor quibbles, in the face of Frozen 2's irresistible charm offensive. Moment to moment, it's a thoroughly enjoyable ride. Elsa's powers lend themselves to an array of eye-popping sequences, whether she's tumbling into the unknown (while singing her new signature tune, ""Into the Unknown"") or gliding through glaciers or confronting horses made of pure water, while Olaf's naivet and flair for the dramatic offer comic relief any time the goings threaten to get too serious.
The original songs, once again by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, might be earworm-y to finally push out all the Frozen 1 songs you've had stuck in your head for the past six years. Fans of these characters will be delighted to see that each gets their due, and there's an unbearably cute critter named Bruni who seems tailor-made to move tons of toys this holiday season.
So Frozen 2's attempts to evolve may not be entirely successful. So Frozen 2 seems like it's doing too much. There's something endearing about watching it try, and stumble, and try again. It's the cinematic equivalent of a tween, sprawling out in all directions without knowing quite where it's headed. In that sense, it's keeping up with the youngest fans of the original, who willed this sequel into being in the first place."
AAY_Doc7_FrozenII,AAY,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II,"Parents, you can breathe a sigh of relief. Frozen 2s new showstopper Into the Unknown isnt as aggressive an earworm as Let it Go. Its more lyrically complex, with a lot more high notes  the kind thatll break your eardrums if sung by anyone who isnt Idina Menzel  and its hard to imagine a car full of kids howling such a delicate scale for hours upon hours.
Frozen 2, Disneys sequel to its $1.3bn hit, is more mature, ambitious, and intricate than its predecessor. That doesnt automatically make it better  Frozens success was built on a simple and relatable story of sisterly love  but its different enough not to feel like a stale rerun. There are surprises here to uncover, and a renewed sense of energy to the proceedings. Admittedly, the film does play with fire by taking the same path as other sequels, padding out a characters backstory in the hope itll add depth to their world. There are echoes of last months Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, as Queen Elsa (Menzel) is carted off to a magical place that might provide a few answers about where she comes from. But Frozen 2 succeeds where so many others have failed.
As the sentient snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) himself neatly summarises in one scene, Elsa made peace with her ice powers at the end of Frozen, when she discovered that the key to it all was love. Now, she rules over Arendelle, while Anna (Kristen Bell) and her boyfriend Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) provide a sense of domestic normalcy through weekly charade sessions.
That is, until a mysterious female voice (provided by Norwegian singer Aurora) pierces the quiet and shakes Elsas soul. Is someone out there looking for her? Does she have a greater purpose beyond the castle walls? Anyone hoping Disney is finally giving Elsa a girlfriend, by the way, will be sorely disappointed  her sexuality still remains purposefully obscure.
Instead, this alluring call draws Elsa into an enchanted forest that feels ripped straight from the pages of Norwegian mythology. There are giants, runes, and an indigenous tribe inspired by the Smi people. Frozen 2 has an authenticity that immediately separates it from so many other subpar follow-ups. Its worldbuilding not only feels earned, but meaningful. Returning directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck ensure that every frame is exquisitely detailed and rich with colour: we move gracefully from autumn leaves to the pinkish glow of ethereal fire, then on to stormy, grey waves and shimmering ice crystals.
Certain sequences here are even more spectacular than the creation of Elsas ice castle, with the filmmakers now more confident to step out of reality and deliver something truly jaw-dropping. Lees screenplay, too, makes some bold choices. She teases out several compelling ideas: environmentalism, reparations, exploitation and how we should confront the past. Its all vague enough that it could be applied to a hundred different real-world situations, which perhaps makes it all the more powerful as a learning tool for families.
But Frozen 2 doesnt lose itself in rootless ambition. It works because were guided through these strange, unfamiliar surroundings by the steady hands of Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf  characters with whom were all very much familiar (or, for some parents, exhaustingly familiar)  and the cast sink straight back into their roles.
Elsa and Annas sense of sisterhood is tested, but ultimately prevails. Kristoff bumbles around with a ring in his pocket, wanting to propose to Anna but never quite finding the right time (he also happens to get what, in truth, might be the films best song  an Eighties power ballad accompanied by a chorus of crooning reindeer).
Olaf remains annoying to those who have always found him so, but those who appreciated his brand of existential humour will be amply rewarded. At one point, he casually shares his theory that advancing technology will be our saviour and our doom.
Frozen 2 may have grown up a little since 2013  just as its fans have  but it never allows itself to lose sight of what made the original click: its warm heart and generous spirit."
AAY_Doc8_FrozenII,AAY,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II,"For many years, Disney resisted the urge to craft big-budget sequels to popular animated films. During the second wave years of the 1990s, a cottage industry was born whereby cut-rate direct-to-home video follow-ups were made but the studio considered these to be ancillary products designed to satisfy a consumer desire and make a few bucks. Modern realities eventually changed long-held policies and a second installment of the hugely popular Frozen franchise became inevitable. Two theatrically-released shorts werent enough to sate demand. Frozen II became one of Disneys most eagerly-awaited animated sequels.
When Frozen was released in 2013, its mix of throwback elements and cutting-edge CGI animation made it Disneys second-most popular non-Pixar branded animated film of all-time (unadjusted for inflation). For the sequel, the decision was made to stick with the elements that made Frozen so popular: themes of sisterhood and family, dashes of romance and comedy, fantasy/adventure elements, and (most importantly) musical numbers. The songwriting team of wife-and-husband Kristen Anderson-Lopez & Robert Lopez and composer Christophe Beck were brought back to create a soundtrack that mimicked but didnt repeat that of Frozen. The result is eight new songs, seven of which recall the Menken/Ashman tunes of the late 1980s/early 1990s and one (Lost in the Woods) which sounds suspiciously like something by REO Speedwagon.
The greatest difficulty faced by writer/director Jennifer Lee and co-director Chris Buck was to tell a story thats new and interesting without relying on regurgitating elements covered by Frozen. It needed to be about going forward more than looking back. While the first movie was inspired by Hans Christen Andersens The Snow Queen, Frozen II appears to draw at least some of its inspiration (both in terms of creature design and plot elements) from the work of Hayao Miyazaki. Thats not surprising since many of the animators at Disney have admitted admiration of the output of Studio Ghibli.
Frozen II opens in the comfortable terrain established by the ending of Frozen. Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel), having harnessed her magical abilities, rules over the peaceful and prosperous city of Arendelle. Her sister, Princess Anna (Kristen Bell), provides advice and support, as befits the beloved younger sibling of a ruler. Annas beau, ice-cutter Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), has decided to ask his royal girlfriend for her hand in marriage but, every time he starts a proposal, he botches it. Finally, snowman Olaf (Josh Gad), now immune to melting (due to his perma-frost), provides on-going comic relief. However, although all seems well, Arendelle is threatened by forces from within a mysterious enchanted forest. Accompanied by her sister and friends, Elsa must penetrate the mist that surrounds the woods, tame the forces of air, water, fire, and earth, and discover the dark secret that threatens her kingdom.
Visually, Frozen II boasts the best photo-realistic imagery of any computer-generated Disney animated release (including those segregated on the Pixar side of the shop). Stunning, crystal-clear visuals are rendered with vibrant hues and just enough of an animated touch so as not to appear too realistic  this isnt an attempt to go toe-to-toe with this summers The Lion King. The movies fantastical scenes show a deftness of touch that bring life to the animators imaginings. One problem with many of todays animated films is that, at least insofar as the visual elements are concerned, a plateau seems to have been reached. What was once eye-popping has become routine. Frozen II has a clarity and purity of appearance that moves the bar, if only by a little.
Musically, its a little surprising that there werent more obvious callbacks to the first films songs. The new material, which will undoubtedly be marketed to the hilt by Disney, is in line with that of Frozen: appealing melodies that, although not immediate standouts, could become popular through pop culture saturation. While the Frozen II soundtrack falls considerably short of Disneys recent best (that of Moana), its good enough to find favor with its target audience.
Although the movie introduces several new characters, including ones voiced by the likes of Sterling K. Brown, Evan Rachel Wood, Ciaran Hinds, and Alfred Molina, its the returning quartet that most viewers will care about and each of the vocal actors  Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, and Josh Gad  slide seamlessly back into their roles, almost as if a day hadnt passed. However, while the characters voices may have remained frozen in time, the same isnt true of those who fell in love with Frozen during its theatrical release and subsequent home video offering. For children, six years is a long time and its an open question whether the passage of time will diminish the franchises magic. (In acknowledgment of this, one of the movies themes is dealing with the change that comes from growing up.) Frozen II is a worthy follow-up with enough heart, action, and music to entertain younger and older viewers alike. It deserves to be held in as high esteem as its predecessor and will hopefully open this world to a new group of youngsters while satisfying the slightly more mature demands of the original films most devoted adherents."
AAY_Doc9_FrozenII,AAY,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II,"Theyre back  the first Disney princesses to persuade the box-office that they dont need a handsome prince to extract them from trouble.
Instead, they rely on sisterly love and co-operation, and its working. Frozen II is already shaping up as the most lucrative animated movie ever made.
It opens as Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) is settling into her routine as queen of Arendelle, her Nordic realm precariously perched on the edge of a fjord. She is satisfied that she has learnt to control the magical gift that has endowed her with the powers of a human ice-making machine and life is looking good. But something is bothering her. The neighbouring forest is enchanted which, in this case, is bad news for its been turned into a no-go zone by a blinding mist so thick that its indigenous residents, the Northuldra, cant get out and everybody else is barred from getting in. Its a stalemate and Elsa is beginning to believe that she can bring it to an end.
The film is directed by the same team who did the original and once again, they have arrived at a judicious mixture of old and new. The action is punctuated with enough songs to fill an MGM musical and although the animation is computer-generated in 3D, its style owes a lot to the glory days of the studios hand-drawn animation era and its traditional Disney princesses with their wide eyes and doll-like faces. The script, however, is scrupulously up-to-date with great attention paid to the films feminist credentials and cultural correctness. After the writers decided to tap into Nordic folklore, Scandinavias Sami communities were consulted and the background artists, were told, were equally scrupulous, composing a landscape without a plant out of place.
It turns out that the forest has gone into lockdown because of environmental damage sustained years earlier. Naturally, human beings were responsible and Elsa and her sister, Anna (Kristen Bell) suspect that the secret is buried in their own familys history. But they can discover the truth only by risking a trip into the forest.
The expedition takes a while to get underway. First, their intentions and fears have to be spelled out in song and their escorts  Olaf, the warm-hearted snowman (Josh Gad), Annas suitor Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer, Sven  have to be briefed.
And when they get there and set about putting things to rights, the script isnt exactly adroit in dreaming up obstacles to impede their progress. Its contrivances are decidedly creaky, the aim being to separate the group of friends so that they become small islands of desperation, each convinced that the others have left them to fend for themselves. The exception is Elsa, who charges off on her own quest, fighting fire, flood and cyclone by shooting out mini-ice floes at every turn. Its impressive enough to suggest that she should be called upon to help in quenching the Californian or our own  bushfires.
Anna and Kristoff lose one another amid the mayhem but she, at least, has Olaf to provide comic relief, which becomes essential when they become trapped in a maze-like cavern deep in the forests forbidding basalt escarpment. The Arendelle scenes are a study in autumnal colours but once we reach the forest, the films palette takes a sudden turn to the dark and wintry.
The climax gives both sisters the chance to be heroes but the most spectacular bits belong to Elsa and her encounters with the Dark Sea, home of the Nokk  an equine water spiritwho doesnt exactly welcome her into his domain. These sequences have a gleam and a rhythm to them that encapsulates Disney animation at its purest and most sinuous.
The film itself doesnt hit that sweet spot that makes Pixar animations, for example, fun for adults as well as their children. Its pace is uneven and in the early scenes, the songs slow down the action so much that the younger kids at my screening were getting restless. But judging from those US box-office figures, theres more than enough here to build on the goodwill generated by the original and create a besotted new audience."
AAY_Doc10_FrozenII,AAY,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II,"Age Appropriate For: 6+. This sequel to the 2013 smash hit Frozen picks up some years after the original and focuses on sisters Anna and Elsa, who learn some secrets about their family that make them question their memories of their parents. A climactic battle is shown between two groups, with hand-to-hand combat and sword fighting, as well as an implied but off-screen assassination; members of those groups have been trapped in a location for decades, always preparing to fight with each other; that same location features some scary elements like moving fire, destructive wind, scary giants, and a dangerous ocean. Beloved characters are shown in danger, including one who disintegrates and one who is frozen; their conditions are temporary but upsetting. Characters in a relationship hug and kiss; there are references to the deaths of Anna and Elsas parents.
Frozen was a phenomenon. Families spent millions of dollars on merchandise; it was adapted for the stage; the songs Let It Go and Do You Want to Build a Snowman? were both played on the radio. Six years later, Frozen 2 arrives with high expectations as to the next chapter for sisters Anna and Elsa, but slightly disappointingly, this new story feels quite a bit like the original.
The film begins some years after the events of Frozen, in which formerly distant sisters Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell) and Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) come together to save their kingdom of Arendelle. Bestowed with magical powers, Elsa is now queen, and although she cares for the people who live in the kingdom and wants to keep it safe, she feels like something is off about her own role. Meanwhile, Anna is in a committed relationship with iceman Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and remains close friends with the sentient snowman Olaf (Josh Gad), who Elsa brought to life, but shes also constantly worried that Elsa will get hurt or leave again. Kristoff wants to propose to Anna, but keeps tripping over himself. And Olaf, now something like a teenager, wonders constantly about the meaning of life. Everyone is getting older, but resisting the changes that naturally come along with increased maturity and responsibility.
And things take a turn when Elsa begins hearing a beautiful voice singing a few notes to her, a voice no one can else hear, drawing her away from Arendelle and toward the Enchanted Forest. As children, Anna and Elsas parents had told them about that place, in which a mysterious battle occurred that drove a wedge between the people of Arendelle and the people of the forest, the Northuldra. All these years later, what could Elsa find there? With her sister, Kristoff, Kristoffs reindeer and best friend Sven, and Olaf by her side, Elsa travels to the forest, where she learns about the elemental magic that makes the place unique and how she fits within it.
Frozen 2 is often astonishingly gorgeous visually, and the movie is truly exceptional in the Enchanted Forest: A salamander has the power to transform into moving fire; earth giants are foreboding and colossal; a playful gust of wind has the same energy as the Magic Carpet from Aladdin, and the horse spirit that Elsa encounters in a dangerous sea is exquisitely detailed. Elsas powerful bursts of snow and ice are fantastic; the film pays special attention to the detail of everyones clothes, and Elsas gowns in particular; and although the song Into the Unknown isnt as instantly memorable as Let It Go, Menzels voice is as compelling as ever.
But in many ways, the movie feels quite similar to its predecessor, and spends its time answering questions that didnt demand resolution. Additional backstory is given regarding how Anna and Elsas parents died, and although that plot helps communicate a lesson about family history and about doing whats right even if your ancestors didnt, the story feels unnecessarily expanded. Although the movie introduces an entirely new community, they primarily serve to expand Anna and Elsa as heroes, which is unfortunate because it reduces the group of natives to props. And ultimately, the narrative beats of the film are the same as Frozen: Anna wants to be closer to Elsa, Elsa wants freedom, and the two sisters push and pull at each other until they reach an affectionate understanding. That relationship makes sense as the young women grow older, but it also made sense in Frozen, too, and Frozen 2 doesnt add much that is unique.
There are joys to Frozen 2, from the beautiful animation to the soaring heights of Into the Unknown to the pitch-perfect voice performances, in particular Groff, who has a little more to do this time around as Kristoff. But the sequel cant quite step out from its predecessors shadow, either in its overall plot arc or its messages about family."
AJD_Doc1_TheMatrixResurrections,AJD,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Matrix Resurrections,"Directed by Lana Wachowski, The Matrix Resurrections marks the unexpected but welcome sequel to the successful trilogy that spanned 1999 to 2003. The Matrix films had become iconic for their themes about liberation from oppression, capitalism, and groupthink and Resurrections follows suit. 

Wachowski and co-writers David Mitchell and Aleksander Hemon make no bones about making their newest script as meta as possible. Using the analogy of a fictional world created by a powerful few in order to control the masses, Resurrections main characters have woken up from the simulationincluding gunslinger Bugs (Jessica Henwick) and returning heroes Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). Through their eyes, we watch a heartbreaking and exhausting world unfold as a controlling class wrings every person dry in the interest of profit. In the real world, as Warner Bros. considered handing over the reins of the Matrix franchise to another writer, theres no denying that Lana Wachowski directly calls out the very studio shes making her film for by critiquing the commodification of art in Resurrections. Its a gutsy move, and one that exactly reflects what The Matrix films are all about.

Visually, the latest chapter boasts impressive special effects. A new, in-film AI machine creates an interactive model of Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) that Im sure will become just as popular as bullet time in future films. However, not all is perfect. While the first three films enjoyed sleek, jaw-dropping fight sequences choreographed by legendary martial artist and film director Yuen Woo-ping (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Master Z: The Legend of Ip Man), his absence in Resurrections feels noticeable. Action scenes can be difficult to see at times, due to obstructive and awkward camera angles. 

Overall, though, the film itself succeeds in its goal to entertain. Furthermore, I found all the nostalgia I was looking for through old characters, some of them reinvisioned to keep things fresh. Newcomer to the franchise Henwick proves why she deserves way more attention in Hollywood than shes currently getting, while Reeves and Moss create just as much magic on screen as they ever did.

Its pretty obvious that Lana Wachowski was not that enthused about continuing the story she and Lily had ended where they wanted it to end. But with Resurrections, she manages to turn out something pretty great and meaningful, despite its technical imperfections.

The theme of being able to conquer anything through love and faith while staying true to who you areespecially in a system where creativity and art are all too often commodifiedremains an enduring tale. Resurrections succeeds in instilling its viewers with the hope that if youre able to find inspiration and a reason to keep trying, your efforts will be worth it in the end. Its a rare example of how an ideal can grow and deepen over time thanks to the love that creators, cast, and crew have for it. Should there be a follow-up, Id happily reenter the meta spun by this team of storytellers. More references to the real world, or to the existence of the John Wick universe, perhaps?"
AJD_Doc2_TheMatrixResurrections,AJD,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Matrix Resurrections,"This long-awaited sequel is a revolutionary and radical capstone to the Wachowskis awe-striking cyberpunk trilogy.

After 22 years, Lana Wachowski returns to the Matrix  a simulation programme designed to deceive humans while their bodies are harvested in amniotic vats for energy. In 1999, Lana and her sister, Lilly, created a cinematic masterpiece that has since evolved and mutated into a branch of philosophy unto itself. From right-wing conspiracists to scholars of trans* theory, the Wachowskis authorial hold on The Matrix as a concept has largely slipped away.

A lot has changed for Lana and Lilly in the last two decades. After completing The Matrix trilogy, they co-directed several ever-expanding movie worlds, from Speed Racer to Jupiter Ascending, which felt like an auteurial sandbox for the pair. While they have their fans, most of these subsequent ventures have flopped at the box office and made a Wachowski project a precarious investment. Will their ideas fly and land safely, or will they fall flat on the pavement?

The process of gender transition both Wachowskis underwent during this period has invited reassessment of their early work. Of course, with The Matrix its all a matter of perspective  the blue pill thinkers may only just be catching on, but for those of us who took the red pill long before it was cool, the transness of these films has always been self-evident. Its always been about seeing beyond the binary and unlocking the infinite possibilities offered in that space.

Thats where the fourth film, The Matrix Resurrections, starts off. We live in a blue pill society. Even Neo downs his blockers by the bottleful, shutting out the trauma of diving down the rabbit hole and, like Alice, accepting that it was just a dream. Readopting his dead name, Neo experiences the events of the first three films as flashbacks, receiving Cognitive Behavioural Therapy from his analyst, played by Neil Patrick Harris.

Like many artists, Neo has been projecting these elusive traumas into a video game called The Matrix, something akin to the MMORPG the Wachowskis created after the films to continue the story of Zion. Its the game that made his name and that everyone knows him for, and after making three instalments, hes been trying to develop an original game called Binary that will take his ideas in a new direction.

These conversations at the start of the film simmer with self-knowing irony. Neo has a meeting with Smith, a version of Hugo Weavings arch-nemesis from the original films, now played menacingly by Jonathan Groff. He tells Neo that Warner Bros want him to go back to The Matrix, to develop what the fans want, leading to a montage of developer meetings mocking everything from bullet time to guns and philosophical allusions set to the psychedelic soundtrack of White Rabbit by Jefferson Airplane.

Coming from any other filmmaker, this could be cringe-inducing. But the Wachowskis are such private individuals, who rarely make any public comment on their personal lives or interpretations of their films, that this feels like a long pent-up final word. Its hardly surprising that Lilly hasnt wanted to be a part of this new film  shes left it in the past, and if Neos experience is deliberately evocative of what the Wachowskis have been through, then its clearly required a lot of personal strength to dig up their past in this way.


The Matrix Resurrections is a heartbreaking depiction of the damage binary thinking can have, especially on trans* people. But its also a beautifully optimistic film which constantly affirms the reality of non-binaryness, and the improvement in quality of life breaking free from our social chains can have. No character is identical in the real world and in the Matrix  every aspect of gender presentation, such as hairstyle and clothing, differs for everyone, a form of switching explored much more explicitly now than it could have been at the turn of the century.

That doesnt mean the blue-pill thinkers wont have a great time with The Matrix Resurrections. Its stunning to watch, a neon-infused matte finish crafted by cinematographers Daniele Massaccesi and John Toll that shows off the improved action choreography and special effects in exciting new ways. And while Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne dont reprise their roles as Smith and Morpheus (there are a hundred canonical reasons why which there simply isnt space to delve into here), its a nostalgic delight to see Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss once again kicking sentinel butt.

But this isnt a film for them, as much as they like to think the world was created for their benefit. Unlike the eye-rolling fan service of recent franchise reboots like Star Wars or Ghostbusters, no reference is made in The Matrix Resurrections without an essential narrative purpose. Its such a rich and original tapestry of world expansion that it will no doubt be analysed as intensively as the original films by scholars for years to come. Once the premise is established, and Lanas had her self-referential fun, buckle your seatbelts for something completely different.

Reeves and Moss are magnificent at resurrecting Neo and Trinity, and they blend exquisitely into Lana Wachowskis matured style of filmmaking. Its wonderful to see the influence of her interim projects on this one  David Mitchell, who wrote the novel Cloud Atlas and collaborated on the writing of the Wachowskis groundbreaking Netflix series Sense8, assisted with the screenplay along with Aleksandar Hamon. And their Cloud Atlas co-director and composer Tom Tykwer brings a lavish update to Don Daviss score that heightens the films atmosphere at every turn.

Collaboration is an essential part of the Wachowskis filmmaking, and while Lilly isnt present here, this isnt a lone effort from Lana. Theres a unique warmth that permeates the screen of love for what everyone is doing, and their deep personal investment in this project seldom felt watching a blockbuster. That includes a smattering of Sense8 alumni, as well as Groff and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who bring refreshing takes on their classic characters.

The Wachowskis love to celebrate newcomers, and Jessica Henwick is sublime as Captain Bugs. Having had a number of small roles in other franchises, her lead turn here keeps The Matrix feeling fresh and alive. The centring of female and non-binary characters in the film feels special and inspires so much hope for the future of cinema. As with all of her work, what Lana Wachowski has achieved in The Matrix Resurrections feels genuinely revolutionary."
AJD_Doc3_TheMatrixResurrections,AJD,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Matrix Resurrections,"A green and black Warner Bros. logo. Streaks of green code cascading down the screen. A tapped phone call. A squad of heavily armed police officers fighting a woman in black leather. Thats the famous opening to The Matrix  and now its also the opening to The Matrix Resurrections. The echoes of the original film are so overwhelming, especially in these first scenes, you could easily think youd started the wrong movie on HBO Max.

Or maybe youre just experiencing dj vu, which the old film famously explained as a glitch in its simulated reality known as The Matrix. That nagging sensation of familiarity not only pervades The Matrix Resurrections, it gives it purpose. Rather than simply rehash the first Matrix, co-writer/director Lana Wachowski has made a movie about (among other things) our collective cultural hunger to rehash old movies like The Matrix. The new movie wrestles with its franchise legacy as aggressively as Neo fighting with an agent  even if it does also indulge in recapitulating the series superficial pleasures like kung fu fights and cool special effects. As Morpheus says at one point in The Matrix Resurrections, nothing comforts anxiety like a little nostalgia.

The Matrix Resurrections is good enough to evoke warm memories of the Wachowskis brilliant first Matrix. Its also talky and confusing enough in its second act to recall the previous pair of Matrix sequels. Of those, Resurrections feels closer to The Matrix Reloaded, another movie of bold ideas, cool visuals, and a fair amount of inscrutable character motivations and technobabble dialogue.

The trailers for the film detail almost none of the actual plot, so I will try my best to talk about the story in broad strokes. Although Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) both died saving the human race in the previous Matrix trilogy, as Resurrections begins, both are inexplicably alive and well and back inside the Matrix  or as well as one can be when trapped inside a manipulative simulation of reality used to drain ones body of its energy so it can be used to power a futuristic race of machines. Neither one remembers their past together. Neo once again works as computer programmer Thomas Anderson while Trinity thinks shes an ordinary woman named Tiffany. The two only occasionally cross paths at their favorite coffee shop, Simulatte. (I will say this for the Matrix: It may be a pernicious system of enslavement, but damn its espresso drinks look incredible.)

Like so many people, Thomas has a good job and is quite successful, but hes deeply unhappy. He goes to a therapist (Neil Patrick Harris) who tries to convince him his feelings are normal and prescribes a regimen of those sinister blue pills that keep people connected to the Matrixs simulation. Still, Neo cant shake the feeling that something is missing, and his suspicions are confirmed when a blue-haired woman named Bugs (Jessica Henwick) takes him by the arm and offers him a red pill, with the promise that she can explain why he feels so disconnected from his own life.

These early scenes are The Matrix Resurrections strongest section, and I have intentionally avoided telling you most of the reasons why (like Neos latest job assignment, for example), so you will just have to take my word on it for now. After Neo escapes the Matrix for the second time, the film becomes less about exploring these larger ideas like middle-aged malaise and the nature of reality, and focuses much more on plot mechanics and exposition; explaining what happened to the world of The Matrix since we last saw it, what the few human survivors are up to now, and why Neo and Trinity are still alive even though we watched them die in The Matrix Revolutions. Even with all the explanations, though, its pretty difficult to follow the intricacies of the story, along with some of its characters motivations. (Im honestly not entirely clear on the full specifics of this new, younger version of Morpheus, played here by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II  and I found another key supporting character even more baffling.)

The thing that always carried The Matrix, even when the earlier sequels got a little hard to follow, were the incredible actions scenes, which were intricately choreographed and shot and edited for maximum clarity. While The Matrix Resurrections fights and chases are stylish, theyre not quite as clear or extravagant as the ones in the earlier films. Whether thats because the performers are older and less light on their feet (Reeves is 57, Moss is 54), or the team had less time to prepare for this film because of the pandemic, or Wachowski decided to go for a visual aesthetic in line with modern blockbusters rather than classic Hong Kong action, the result is a movie that is less viscerally thrilling than I expected or wanted.

The thing that carries The Matrix Resurrections through some of those rough patches instead is Wachowskis obvious affection for the characters, and the actors reciprocal love for this world and its endless intellectual curiosities. Reeves and Moss both look fantastic for their ages  or for any age, really  but they are older, and they do imbue their characters wistful, unfulfilled stares at one another with a lot of depth of feeling for the time theyve lost. The story may not be the clearest, but the movie always keeps the connection between Neo and Trinity in focus, and thats ultimately what matters.

I do wish Trinity appeared onscreen more; her choices drive the story, but shes mostly seen at that one coffee shop, and usually from Neos perspective. But where the movie ultimately arrives at, and what it says about Neo and Trinitys shared evolution (and what that symbolizes for people in the audience) is legitimately moving. Even amidst all of the technical jargon and epic sci-fi stakes, the film really does come down to this personal connection between two lost souls. Thats something it has in common with the first Matrix too.

Additional Thoughts:

-While most of the updates to The Matrixs technology work, the new film does miss the old school mechanics of going into and out of the Matrix through hardwired phones. While modern audiences might not have quite understood their usage because no one has a landline anymore, the movie misses the suspense of having to find and use this rare analog object to escape from this system of computer control. Resurrections replaces that with various doors and mirrors and portals, and its not entirely clear how or when they can or cant be used, and as a result, the film is far less suspenseful."
AJD_Doc4_TheMatrixResurrections,AJD,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Matrix Resurrections,"What other future could you imagine for The Matrix  the foremost reality-rupturing cultural phenomenon of the 20th century  than for its latest sequel to reveal that its all just been a fiction contained within its own protagonists head?

When were first re-introduced to Neo (Keanu Reeves), hes back (somewhere) living under his old, fake identity of Thomas Anderson  now the widely acclaimed designer of a video game called the Matrix, which is, at almost every level, the same as the 1999 film we experienced in our reality. That realityalso includes the two sequels, Reloaded and Revolutions, which in this universe dont seem to have been so unfairly maligned by the cultural consensus. He meets regularly with his therapist (Neil Patrick Harris), who helps him better define the lines between his reality and his fiction. But hold on  are those two things really separate at all? Somewhere, within that chaotic intersection of Neos life, art and memories, lies the truth that will finally set him free.

Already confused? Good. That means the Matrix is back, doing what it does best. Its a volcanic cluster of ideas at a time when Hollywood is all-too content to slap the broad declaration of its really about trauma! on a film and call it a day. And that comes largely from the determined individualism of its director, Lana Wachowski (here taking solo reins of the franchise from her sister and usual co-director, Lilly)  whose outlook on The Matrix Resurrections both reasserts her personal vision and takes stock of the franchises thorny legacy. Its also a reminder that long black coats and tiny sunglasses are, indeed, very cool.

Neo, at one point, is told that the powers-that-be took your story and made it something trivial. In Reevess pained response lies the mirror image of what the Wachowskis must surely have felt over the past two decades. Their greatest and most personal creation, rooted in their experiences as trans women, has become so diluted and divorced from its original meaning that the image of the red and blue pill is now co-opted by the alt-right as a way to publicly out themselves as conspiracy theorists and bigots.

Early on, Neos business partner (Jonathan Groff) reveals that their parent company, Warner Bros, has ordered a new Matrix sequel. If they dont play along and agree to it, theyll simply be bought out of their contract. Its a sly reminder to audiences that this fourth Matrix instalment was, initially, developed without the involvement of the Wachowskis  cut to a writers room of bright-eyed millennials blithely tossing around ideas about what The Matrix is actually about, whether it be trans politics, crypto-fascism, or capitalist excess.

Whether or not it was created under duress, The Matrix Resurrections allows Lana her final say. Her script, co-written with novelists Aleksandar Hemon and David Mitchell (of Cloud Atlas fame), revisits the original trilogys ideas of self-liberation, rooted in Neos initial discovery that his entire world is but a computer simulation, a distraction from the reality that the human race has been turned into a living battery by the machines it failed to control. But it also uses those same themes to reach a new conclusion  that all binaries are bulls***, whether they be saviour versus saved, us versus them, or man versus machine. Even the choice between red and blue pill is something of an oversimplification.

The new cast  Groff, Harris, Jessica Henwick, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Priyanka Chopra Jonas  all play a kaleidoscope of shifting identities. The film, admittedly, lacks a set piece quite as stark and revolutionary as the first use of bullet time, or the way Neo stopping bullets in mid-air for the first time really did feel like seeing the face of God. But it happily revisits and remixes all the familiar elements in ways that seem more attuned to the needs of characters than to the demands of spectacle.

Reeves? He still knows kung-fu. Henwick? Shes the natural action star here and defies gravity with steely grace. Abdul-Mateen? He dons a burnt-orange suit and discharges bullets from guns like theyre confetti streamers. Groff? He rips a sink off a wall with such ferocity that youll never be able to watch him in Hamilton the same way again.

But, for all the films souped-up shootouts, or its philosophising over minds and bodies, its love that ultimately emerges as the most transgressive force in the universe. When Neo drops by his local coffee establishment (called Simulatte, of course), we discover that hes been harbouring a secret infatuation for one of its regulars, Tiffany (Carrie-Anne Moss), who bears a striking resemblance to the woman named Trinity in his game.

Reeves and Mosss chemistry is as scorching-hot as it has always been  when they talk, the actors perfectly modulate their slightly too long-held glances and micro-smiles, so that these supposed strangers still act as if theyve known each other since the dawn of time. The Matrix Resurrections ends with a literal call to the powers of sentimentality, empowerment and freedom  it ponders whether humanity finds any value in them which, in turn, seems to really ask whether audiences still have any interest in blockbusters of this purity and ambition. For my own stake, at least, I hope they do."
AJD_Doc5_TheMatrixResurrections,AJD,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Matrix Resurrections,"How do you follow up a perfect movie? Its a question thats haunted ""The Matrix"" franchise since the Wachowskis changed sci-fi action cinema forever in 1999. And its one that explicitly sits at the heart of this long-awaited fourth installment, which is set for a simultaneous release in theaters and on HBO Max. 

While the previous two sequels went the more serious route  adding ponderous philosophizing, complicated worldbuilding and pointed narrative subversions to the simple, propulsive thrill ride of the first film  ""The Matrix Resurrections"" takes the opposite approach.
This is a surprisingly playful, lighthearted film with a meta take on the idea of revisiting/rebooting a beloved franchise with a complicated cultural legacy. That makes ""Resurrections"" a wickedly entertaining, delightfully romantic addition to the ""Matrix"" canon  one that may prove divisive for those looking for a hardcore action flick, but will offer plenty of rewards for those willing to open their minds to a new kind of blockbuster. 

The last we saw prophesied savior Neo (Keanu Reeves) and his lover Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) back in 2003s ""The Matrix Revolutions,"" they were sacrificing their lives to forge a more peaceful co-existence between humanity and machines.

Unspooling the mystery of how the actors are back and why theyre living seemingly normal contemporary lives is part of the films fun. But suffice it to say that returning co-writer/director Lana Wachowski (handling the reigns without her sister Lilly this time around) has come up with a clever way to allow her characters to preemptively voice any and all concerns you might have about revisiting a film as iconic as ""The Matrix."" (""What if I cant be what I once was?"" Neo asks at one point.)

In fact, there are moments in the opening act that are so playfully self-aware, it sometimes seems like the movie is going to function more as a parody of Hollywoods sequel-obsession than an actual narrative feature. Wachowskis frequent use of footage from the first three films creates a sort of storytelling ouroboros where fan service winks become literal narrative building blocks.

This is also clearly a film made by a woman whos spent the past 20 years fending off requests to make more ""Matrix"" movies, and has no problems airing her grievances onscreen. Few things are as surreal as hearing characters within a ""Matrix"" sequel openly discuss the idea of a ""Matrix"" sequel. 

Thankfully, ""Resurrections"" offers real heart to balance the meta fun. While all of ""The Matrix"" films have, in some way, centered around Neo and Trinitys romance, ""Resurrections"" turns that into its raison d'tre. 

This is a star-crossed love story above all else  one that sees Wachowski playing in the earnest, openhearted key of projects like ""Jupiter Ascending"" and ""Sense8."" 

In the two decades since ""The Matrix"" was released, Wachowski has clearly done some thinking about how that original film positioned its central couple, and ""Resurrections"" lets her reconfigure their dynamic in delightful ways. In particular, ""Resurrections"" makes fantastic use of Reeves inherit tenderness, as if Wachowski has come to realize that Neo works far better as a soft boi gently fawning over his crush than a badass action hero duty bound to save the world. 

Moss, meanwhile, has a role that seems less showy at first but pivots in compelling ways. Its part of the films moving thesis that even if we can never fully end the battle against corrupt forces, we have the power to change the nature of what ""us vs. them"" looks like.

What ""Resurrections"" is missing, unfortunately, is the sort of eye-popping action that defined the original trilogy. Things feel a bit more rote this time around, partially because the stylistic flourishes ""The Matrix"" pioneered have now become standard blockbuster practice. ""Resurrections"" delivers what it needs to on the action front without moving the genre forward in any meaningful way. 

Instead, its the films refreshingly colorful world that stands out more than any particular action setpiece. Get ready for jewel-toned suits in place of black leather jackets, and a brightly saturated aesthetic that makes for a welcome change of pace from Marvels visually murky blockbusters.

And what ""Resurrections"" lacks in action pyrotechnics, it makes up for in a welcome sense of narrative simplicity. While you basically needed a PhD in computer programming to understand anything that happened in the previous two sequels, this one is much more straightforward. 

There are deep cut Easter eggs (hello Merovingian!) and cyberpunk thematic depth for those who want to seek them out. But even casual fans will be able to tell the baddies from the goodies, and roughly track everyones overarching motivation  which is far more than can be said for the last two films. 

That makes space for incredibly fun performances from franchise newcomers like Jessica Henwick as a badass hacker, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as a Morpheus-esque figure and especially Jonathan Groff as a smarmy antagonist. (Also on hand, somewhat less compellingly, is Neil Patrick Harris as Neos mysterious therapist.) 

By the end of ""Resurrections,"" there are things you wish wove together a little more firmly or paid off a little bit more. On the whole, this is more of an ellipsis to the original trilogy than a definitive final chapter, with plenty of questions about where, if anywhere, the franchise goes from here.

Yet its also a film that feels greater than the sum of its parts. Wachowski proudly sticks to her guns about controversial elements of the original trilogy shed like to keep, while maintaining a refreshing lack of ego when it comes to making fun of stuff that didnt quite work. (Neos ability to fly somehow falls into both categories at once.)

Above all, theres a real sense of joy here  both from a cast who are clearly ecstatic to be back in this world; and for the characters themselves, who find new hope in revisiting the past. 

Playful, earnest and romantic might not be a tone people want from their ""Matrix"" sequel, just as ponderous philosophizing wasnt what they wanted back in 2003. Those willing to follow this particular white rabbit, however, will find themselves in an enthralling Wonderland."
AJD_Doc6_TheMatrixResurrections,AJD,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Matrix Resurrections,"There's more just than a glitch in the Matrix. The entire server is down. 

""The Matrix Resurrections,"" the fourth chapter in the reality-bending sci-fi action series and the first in 18 long years, is a major malfunction, a confusing, muddled, painful meta-commentary on ""The Matrix"" wrapped up in a visually sluggish, directionless misfire. Say what you will about the ""Matrix"" movies  our collective memory has all but wiped the second and third chapters in the series from our mainframe, and rightfully so  but their action has never looked or moved so flatly.  

Writer-director Lana Wachowski, working for the first time without her sibling Lilly Wachowski, spends half of the movie wink-winking at ""The Matrix's"" place in pop-culture lore and the other half delving into a love story, with a whole lot of head-spinning blabbity-babble tying the two parts together.

Along the way, all the things expected out of a ""Matrix"" movie that once made the series a marvel of cyberpunk and techno-cool  the glitchy computer graphics, the kung-fu fight choreography, the gravity-defying and boundary-pushing action sequences, the black leather fetishism  feel dashed off or incomplete, like someone picked up the phone line while the dial-up internet was still connecting. Red pill or blue? Take whichever one gets this debacle over quicker. 

The immortal Keanu Reeves returns as Neo, but first off he's back to being Thomas Anderson, living in a staid reality where he's the creator of a wildly popular trilogy of groundbreaking video games called, you guessed it, ""The Matrix."" This series of films, er, video games shaped the way we looked at reality in the late '90s and early '00s, and now Warner Bros. (checked by name!) is looking to reboot the series to cash in on its popularity, with or without its lead designer. Basically, it's a whole lot of talking about the influence and radicalness of ""The Matrix,"" inside the realm of a ""Matrix"" movie. (Think of it as Lana Wachowski's version of ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare,"" the 1994 ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" entry where reality folded in on itself.) 

This alternate universe allows for exactly one good inside joke: a ""Matrix""-inspired franchise of coffee shops named Simulatte, complete with trickling black and green characters logo. (That's good  credit where credit's due.) It's at Simulatte where Thomas spots Tiffany (Carrie-Anne Moss), a mom with a couple of kids and a husband named Chad, to whom he has a connection he can't quite place his finger on. Before you can say, ""it's Trinity, bro!"" we're plucked back into the Matrix, the grungy world that's designed to look like the cold metal of a gun chamber that's ruled by machines who use humans as batteries, and the world as we know it is all a grand simulation.

Except things inside this Matrix aren't quite the same as they once were. Morpheus is now played by ""Candyman's"" Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and it's not really explained why he's no longer in the form of Laurence Fishburne, who can currently be seen in Peacock's ""MacGruber"" series. (That's not to say Fishburne chose one project over the other, it's just to state plain facts of where Fishburne can and can't be seen.) And Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith is nowhere to be found, here Smith is played by ""Mindhunter's"" Jonathan Groff, and he's Thomas' boss at the video game company, cracking the whip on him to get going on that fourth installment.

A smarmy Neil Patrick Harris is on board as Thomas' therapist, known as the Analyst, and Christina Ricci  who starred in the Wachowski's ""Speed Racer""  shows up for one scene and then never again. 

Bouncing around inside and outside of the Matrix, Wachowski liberally sprinkles footage from the previous films into the mix like a ""Rocky"" montage. (The old footage is sometimes meant to represent clips from the video games, which makes no sense.) 

The engine driving ""Resurrections"" is the reunion of Neo and Trinity, and the path to getting there involves at least one very long monologue by Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), which might explain things if it wasn't so impossible to follow. 

Having navigated ""The Matrix"" through three previous installments, audiences know better now than to expect clear, concise plot lines from a ""Matrix"" film. (I'm still not even sure I have a firm grip on the first film, but I've got about 75-80% of it down.) But where earlier installments could be leaned on for cutting-edge action sequences  even the second chapter had that bananas freeway chase  the action here is mostly ho-hum, been-there-done-that recreations of earlier stunts. Even when characters run up and across walls and come back down to fell an opponent, which happens a lot here, it's nothing special, and it's never shot in a way that makes it a wow moment. It's mostly an ""oh, OK"" moment. (The wow moments never truly arrive, though the climax comes closest.)

It's not surprising that ""The Matrix Resurrections"" doesn't rewrite history or blow minds; the Wachowskis struggled even in 2003 to bring coherence to its follow-ups, and the team's most recent films  2012's overblown ""Cloud Atlas"" and 2015's abysmal ""Jupiter Ascending""  were large-scale disappointments. 

""Resurrections,"" though, is the first movie that finds Wachowski overtly looking back, and she reflects a potentially fraught relationship with the series and its success. It's as if she's writing off ""The Matrix,"" and she makes it all too easy to join her. ""Resurrections"" is a hard crash back into reality."
AJD_Doc7_TheMatrixResurrections,AJD,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Matrix Resurrections,"In 1999, Morpheus said to Neo in The Matrix, Ill show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

In 2021, I say, Must you, Morphy? Ill take the blue pill, please.

The fourth movie of the needlessly prolonged franchise, coming 18 years after the horrendous The Matrix Revolutions, is The Matrix Resurrections, a descent not so much into Lana and Lilly Wachowskis ever-fascinating dystopian reality as our own madness.

Beyond the initial satisfaction of seeing Keanu Reeves, whom we regularly watch in plenty of much better movies anyway, and Carrie-Anne Moss return as sunglasses-lovin power couple Neo and Trinity, Resurrections is aimless, vocabulary-filled, talky tedium.

Its set after the events of Revolutions, which had Neo pull a Jesus and sacrifice himself for the greater good while the Matrix  a digitized world that humans, trapped by machines, confuse for real life  is rebooted. These days, Neo is a video game designer whos famous for creating one called  get ready to hurl  The Matrix!

The cringey self-awareness doesnt stop there.
Our beloved parent company Warner Bros. has decided to make a sequel to the trilogy, says his boss Smith (Jonathan Groff, likably evil) in a line right outta Space Jam: A New Legacy.

When his team tries to re-create the success of their earlier creation, another designer points out, We need a new bullet time,  referring to the pioneering 360-degree slow-motion technology made famous by the original film. 

Still, Neo, whose real name is Thomas, has a sneaking suspicion his memories of the Matrix, Trinity and the hidden human city of Zion might be real. Hes even been discussing it with a therapist (Neil Patrick Harris), whose black cat is named Deja Vu. When that feline moniker is revealed, you silently scream into your popcorn.

Turns out Neo was right. One day Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) shows up in the office bathroom and gives him the alternate-reality lowdown, only Morpheus no longer looks like Laurence Fishburne and also moonlights as one of the villainous agents. This change-up is confusingly explained in calm, condescending technobabble, like a cult leader telling why its obvious that aliens are on their way to pick us up.

Then, with the help of a new character named Bugs (Jessica Henwick), Neo takes the red pill and wakes up in one of those gross human pods all over again with one goal: Bring back Trinity.
No Matrix movie has ever matched the forceful simplicity of the first one (we are prisoners to machines and need to be free), and Resurrections is a full-on lecture at MIT.

As we flip through Lana Wachowskis syllabus, theres more talking than a 24-hour marathon of The View. The chatter problem began in Reloaded, as too many characters with perplexing motivations and silly names were thrown into the mix  the Merovingian, the Keymaker, the Architect  that made the story too video-game-like. Then Revolutions added the Trainman and Sati for good measure. The new movie shoves in yet more people who blather on about metaphysics and philosophy and attempt to advance plenty of underdeveloped plot lines.

We are quickly told, for instance, that the machines are now at war with each other on occasion, and Bugs and her crew (all unmemorable) have metallic machine pals who are in the shape of sweet animals.

The best part is Moss, whose eyes still burn and whose outward gentility conceals a grave threat.
So, whos the villain? Sort of Smith, who explains that he is the old Agent Smith but also isnt. But a bigger, profoundly unsatisfying baddie is revealed later on.

After two lousy sequels, heres a pitch for Warner Bros.: The Matrix Retirement. 
The best part is Moss, whose eyes still burn and whose outward gentility conceals a grave threat, but shes not in it enough. Jada Pinkett Smith is given ridiculous old-age makeup as the leader of the humans.

With Lana Wachowski returning to direct, we at least hope for the visual dazzlement and boundless creativity of the fight scenes that made the first two films great. Sorry, guys. The fourth flick looks dollar-store cheap and during the battles, youll wish you were watching John Wick instead.

After two lousy sequels, heres a pitch for Warner Bros.: The Matrix Retirement. "
AJD_Doc8_TheMatrixResurrections,AJD,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Matrix Resurrections,"Eighteen years after what we thought was the third and final Matrix film, The Matrix Revolutions, Lana Wachowski has directed a fourth: The Matrix Resurrections. But despite some ingenious touches (a very funny name, for example, for a VR coffee shop) the boulder has been rolled back from the tomb to reveal that the franchises corpse is sadly still in there. This is a heavy-footed reboot which doesnt offer a compelling reason for its existence other than to gouge a fourth income stream from Matrix fans, submissively hooked up for new content, and it doesnt have anything approaching the breathtaking bullet time action sequences that made the original film famous.

I want to get as much done as I can: Keanu Reeves on poetry, grief and making the most of every minute
The first Matrix was a brilliant, prescient sci-fi action thriller that in 1999 presented us with Keanu Reeves as a computer hacker codenamed Neo, stumbling across the apparent activity of a police state whose workings he scarcely suspected. Charismatic rebel Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) brings Neo to the mysterious figure of Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who offers our reluctant hero one of the most famous choices in modern cinema: the blue pill or the red pill. The first will allow Neo back into his torpid quasi-contentment, the second will irreversibly reveal to him the truth about all existence. He swallows the red and discovers all our lives exist in a digitally fabricated, illusory world, while our comatose bodies are milked for their energies in giant farms by our machine overlords.

A vivacious and underrated sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, appeared in 2003 and later in the same year The Matrix Revolutions, in which the idea ran definitively out of steam: the awful truth was that the drab reality in which the rebels were fighting their tedious intergalactic war against these machines looked like Battlefield Earth, the dire sci-fi movie starring John Travolta.

But the red pill and the blue pill was an irresistible meme gifted to political discourse at the dawn of the online age. Christopher Nolans Inception was surely influenced by The Matrix and when Successions digital media baron Lukas Matsson, played by Alexander Skarsgrd, contemptuously compares social media users to Roman slaves, he is echoing ideas touted by the original film. Jeff Orlowskis documentary The Social Dilemma, about social media serfdom, comes with Matrix-esque imagery  and Mark Zuckerberg is attempting to craft a new digital world called Meta. Moreover Lilly Wachowski, the originals co-director, has intriguingly discussed the world of Matrix and its relevance to the dissenting politics of gender.

The fourth movie wittily begins by showing us Neo in haggard and depressed middle age, operating under his normal name Thomas Anderson: he is an award-winning but burnt-out game programmer. But there are weird eruptions from within his alt.reality: an activist called Bugs (Jessica Henwick) tries to make contact with him, along with a renegade government agent (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who has assumed the persona of Morpheus. Meanwhile, Thomass obnoxious billionaire employer Smith (Jonathan Groff) seems a parallel version of the sinister Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving in the original films. But Thomass analyst (Neil Patrick Harris) is on hand to assure him that this is all just his imagination. But is it? And is Thomas still deeply in love with Trinity, whom he sees every day in his local coffee shop?

In some ways, The Matrix Resurrections has a degree of charm as a love story of middle age, and usually returning action franchises give their ageing male lead a younger female co-star. Not here: its a pleasure to see Moss return, but a shame to see her given so little interesting to do. The Matrix is an idea that is most exciting when it is starting to come apart: when there is a glitch. But the franchise is now a glitch-less narrative: we basically know all about the illusion and the Battlefield Earth reality out there in space which is where we are largely marooned: a huge, dispiriting crepuscular ruined cityscape glowing at its rocky edges, like the Verneian interior of a volcano. And the nature of the machines thinking and their motivations is not really solved by this fourth film, despite some playful new ideas about whether some of them are disloyal to their side. Lambert Wilsons character The Merovingian, a veteran of the Machine War, returns, ranting enjoyably about the superiority of art, music and pre-digital conversation.

Really, Resurrections doesnt do much to remove the anticlimax that hung like a cloud over the cinema auditorium at the end of the third film in 2003. This movie is set up to initiate a possible new series, but there is no real creative life in it. Where the original film was explosively innovatory, this is just another piece of IP, an algorithm of unoriginality."
AJD_Doc9_TheMatrixResurrections,AJD,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Matrix Resurrections,"Imagine if we were all a dream in the mind of a particularly boring and unimaginative God. Okay, thats a little unfair. But there is little in this uninspiring Matrix revival to debunk the creaky old saw  not actually down to Einstein  that madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. The first two sequels were dreary duds. Why would things be any different two decades later?

A lot has happened in the interim. Right-wing blowhards have adopted the red pill/blue pill thing as an analogy for opening oneself up to the realisation that communist lizards rule the universe (or something). Some of the first films prophecies about malign power of technology have, if not exactly born fruit, then swollen a few buds. There is potential here for satirical invention.

Sadly, Lana Wachowski, now directing without her sister Lilly, has failed to work up many new moves worth savouring. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss look better than they have any right to look  it must be those hardy Canadian genes  but the film feels trapped in the last centurys out door. The clothes and sunglasses alone are hilariously out of the mode. What was once the coolest of images has now become the preserve of teenage superhero obsessives from rust-belt suburbs. So much of the new film looks like the work of uncharacteristically well-heeled attendees at San Diego Comic-Con. One half-suspects a bald 40-year-old dressed as Thor is standing just outside the frame.

The story works through the greatest hits with drab efficiency  'I still know Kung Fu.' Really?  and adds precious few fresh flourishes
To be fair, some self-awareness is on display. We begin with Reevess Thomas A Anderson, the former Neo, living a stressed life as a video-game designer in San Francisco. The story we know as the Matrix trilogy is his most successful creation. We learn that the firms beloved partners at Warner Bros are going to create a sequel even if the original team doesnt get on board. Ha ha! We appear, at this point, to be edging towards Scream 2 territory  or even the work of Charlie Kaufman  but the picture quickly gives into weak clutches at the first films receding energies. Somebody arrives with a pair of pills. There is chatter about the rice-paper thinness of reality. We are soon back with the descending green code, the curiously powered vehicles and an anxiety that we may not get home in time for ER (for which we forgot to programme the VHS).

It baffles the brain to learn that Lana wrote the screenplay with the gifted novelists David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemon. The story works through the greatest hits with drab efficiency  I still know Kung Fu. Really?  and adds precious few fresh flourishes. That opening conceit about the video game is nicely done, but it quickly becomes an irrelevance. What variations we get on the philosophy tends to be delivered in lengthy duologues that recall the worst excesses of The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. Neil Patrick Harris has a few good moments as a sinister analyst who may not have Neos best interests at heart.

Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss look better than they have any right to look  it must be those hardy Canadian genes
But every stretch of decent writing is undermined by lines so clunky you find yourself doubting reality (can this have been the intent?). Someone does actually say I guess its deja vu all over again. In 2021. In a film written by grown professionals. The one later self-conscious variation that does work involves a ranting old maniac  we shant say where he springs from  who lays out all thats wrong with modern culture and the wired, post-Matrix generation. It is a cute moment that passes all too quickly.

In Lana Wachowskis defence, much of Resurrections does play like a sincere conversation with herself. She and her sister invented this extraordinary world, and they have the right to analyse and deconstruct it. But she is a victim of her own early success. One would like to say the film looks like a 2005 perfume commercial influenced by The Matrix, but, in truth, scent ads tend to be a bit more stylish than this. The moment has gone."
AJD_Doc10_TheMatrixResurrections,AJD,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Matrix Resurrections,"For goddess sake, take the blue pill! Okay, the lighting in the Matrix isnt great, and everything has an eerie green tintbecause thats how old timey computers were presumed to look in the late nineties. But its so much worse underground. When Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) emerges downstairs, jellyfaced and crestfallen, like a lubed-up Dave Bautista making his way out of a birthing canal for douchebags, he surely must realize what a stupid, pointless mistake hes made. Choose the nice gay therapist! Choose the sycophants and the milf in the coffee shop!

But no, alas. Down the rabbit hole goes Keanu and so, therefore, must we. At the opening of The Matrix: Resurrections, the execrable latest submission to the all-too-explicably popular franchise, we encounter the once and forever Ted Theodore Logan, forced to endure a group of sycophants telling him how great The Matrix was. In the new Matrix in which he is unknowingly imprisoned, Mr. Anderson is a video-game developer who made three successful games about a virtual reality system used to placate people while their bodies are kept bolted to tanks and used as a fuel source. (Well get back to the first law of thermodynamics in due course.)

Suddenly, a new idea: Why dont we make a fourth installment of the Matrix series? And Thomas Anderson must endure a montage of sycophants tell him how radiant, timely, and far-sighted the original was; how beautiful the bullet sequences; what a head fuck (in the good sense); how it predicted trans politics and capitalist exploitation. A lone dissenting voice registers that The Matrix wasnt his cup of tea because, if anything, it was a bit too brilliantly incisive, and he doesnt like anything that comes with a syllabus.

At which point I was like, excuse me. Far be it from mea pretentious transsexual who has never come without a syllabusto take exception to a fun techno-thriller franchise, especially one which has been (manifestly) valuable to a lot of queer and trans people. But come the fuck on. I was genuinely shocked to learn that The Matrix thinks that the problem with The Matrix is that it is too cerebral. It is hard to think of any franchise of the last few decades that has invested more lavishly in willed, militant stupidity. It is one long rhetorical questionwhat if reality was just a simulation designed to keep our minds placated for nefarious purposesthat brooks no clarifying follow-ups, let alone answers. One neednt ask, Have you read even the first of Descartes Mditations? because the answer is obvious, but one cant but ask: How have human bodies been transformed into net producers of energy? Why must the agents interact with the Matrix at all, when they could simply switch off the life-glug?

Orlets try this one on for sizewhy can the faces of the various Matrix characters be altered, but not their presentations of racialized animatedness? The wise old Black lady played by Gloria Foster in the first two movies was replaced by Mary Alice in the third, but while the characters face changed, the breadth of the stereotype was reproduced in every offensive particular. Meanwhile, the excellent Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who has the distinction of being the only person to have delivered an engaging performance in any of the four movies, wisely declines to imitate Laurence Fishburnes sepulchral drone, and dresses in snappy, colorful suits, as if he were a postcard from another Matrix, where someoneanyonepossesses the slightest glimmer of taste. But its difficult to enjoy Abdul-Mateens performance, even so, because it glows so much brighter than the rest of the movie, and one wonders why the only Black man in a major role has been charged with animating a universe otherwise nightmarishly bourgeois above, and grimly proletarian below. I did rather enjoy Jonathan Groffs turn as Agent Smith, toohe seems to be pitching himself as a milkier Michael Sheen, and Im here for itbut that may have been relief at being spared Hugo Weavings eyebrow waggles, his Smith being a serious contender for the single worst performance delivered in a major studio picture of all time.

To be clear, I like all of these peopleReeves is obviously great; Weavings capable of having fun (as he does in the Wachowskis Cloud Atlas), Carrie-Anne Moss is weirdly frumpy in a way one cant but applaud. The awfulness of the Matrix series is a problem: It wasnt self-evident that something so joyless, turgid, and self-impressed would emerge from this particular set of tools. The Wachowski sisters arent likely future Oscar winners, but theyre capable of better than this; the actors are all fine, and Abdul-Mateem is positively good (honestly Im not sure Ive seen a more Oscar-worthy performance this year than his turn in Candyman). And theres clearly money swimming around: a sequence on a Japanese train looks pretty and must have been tricky to shoot (and, in any case, it stands to reason that anything with as broad and defensive an audience as these movies wont find it hard to raise the dough).

So wheres the problem? Whats on the syllabus, Prof. Wachowski? (Only Lana this time; Lilly wisely having bolted.) We have Lewis Carroll represented by a tattoo on the arm of Jessica Henwicks Bugs, an exposition-emitter with a gun, and also by Jefferson Airplanes White Rabbit, which reveals by negative impression its novelty: in the entire soundtrack to the first movie, one hears only the voices of angry white men. A little Columbine-chic fashion: I realized, rewatching the old movies yesterday, that the elegantly distressed and ever-so-umble fashions of the 250,000 denizens of Zion looked a bit like Rick Owens circa 2010, though the fact is not to Ricks credit. Eighties/nineties tech thrillersLawnmower Man, The Net, Tronfixed the visual style as a neon-textured light-emitting diode on black (like a sexy little calculator), nodding to the perilous abstraction of mediated life. Theres the Hong Kong martial arts movies that the fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping adapted for the first two Matrix movies, as he did for Kill Bill a couple of years later, producing a suite of arresting and beautiful sequences, none of which are equalled in Resurrectionspresumably because Yuen himself didnt return. And 1990s Vertigo comics: the name Morpheus surely comes from Neil Gaiman; the magic mirror is from Grant Morrison, as is the awkward and envious relation to queerness personified here in Neil Patrick Harriss therapist-cum-demiurge; Alan Moore, who wrote V for Vendetta, which the Wachowskis adapted, supplies the ambient grievance.

I think Ive figured this metaphor out. Its not trans politics. Its not capitalist exploitation. This is an exultation of thoughtless mediocrity: imagine if you, peon that you are, at your computer console in your disenchanted world, were in fact the exiled prince of a distant, doomed land, to which you must return in glory. In this special land, you can fly! You can dodge bullets; you are the messiah. Some other peon who, in other respects, resembles you, scrambles up to you and tells you hes such a fanboy. You will rise again in glory, and you will show everyone, especially your gay therapist, who wants to castrate you. But no. Please. Listen to your gay therapist. Take the blue pill."
ARL_Doc1_RedNotice,ARL,Comedy,Positive,Red Notice,"NEW TO NETFLIX! Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, Red Notice tells the story of unlikely partners doing what they can to save a priceless piece of history. FBI agent John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) gets a tip that one of the most expensive art pieces in the world is about to be stolen. When it is, he is forced to team up with art thief Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) to track and take down the most prolific art thief in the world, The Bishop (Gal Gadot). With bumps along the way, the union of Hartley and Booth will prove to be far more difficult than either expected, but their journey will be one for the books.
Anyone who has followed Dwayne Johnson throughout his acting career is well aware that nearly every one of his films is absurd but tons of fun. Point being the Fast and Furious series: he jumps from buildings, survives massive explosions, and completes feats that would, for anyone else, be impossible. The neverending action, the ridiculous comedy, and the incredible journeys on which Johnsons characters often take viewers serve their purpose and typically entertain (sometimes ironically) from beginning to end. Red Notice, in nearly every way, except for the characters names, could be part of the Fast and Furious franchise. The action is uncanny, the comedy absurd, and every second is incredibly fun.
The three Hollywood titans play so well together they allow the best of each other to come out and are imminently watchable and fun from the jump. Sure, some terrific actors are present, but given that Johnsons movies arent predicated on superb acting, my expectation was for something average while other aspects shined brightly. I couldnt have been more wrong, as each of those three leads is so incredibly astute in their performances. In fact, this may be Gal Gadots best performance to date. Dwayne Johnson is his typical, charming, delightful self.
Ryan Reynolds isnt typically known for his deep, complex roles, as he generally is seen as a comedian, which he handles incredibly well. However, Red Notice allows him to shine in dramatic moments as well, and his performance is beautiful. There arent many heavy beats present, but the actor hits each one brilliantly.
If youre looking for something realistic with true emotional relevance, well, then Thurbers action-comedy isnt for you. There are touching tidbits sprinkled throughout, but what you are going to get is the high-octane action and incredible stunts for which Johnson has come to be known. In terms of action and story, the action flick is precisely what one might expect going in. But, it is even more fun than I could have hoped.
The marriage of Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot is beautiful, and they support one another incredibly well. Red Notice is an example of the best of what these three have to offer the world, and Im impressed by what this cast and crew bring to the table. Its funny, action-packed, and fun, which is exactly as it should be.

ARL_Doc2_RedNotice,ARL,Comedy,Negative,Red Notice,"Rawson Marshall Thurbers Red Notice should work on paper. Its got a charismatic cast sent globe-hopping to beautiful places on a treasure hunt straight out of an Indiana Jones movie. How could it go wrong? Well, for starters, Thurber and everyone involved forgot a little thing called personality. Rarely have I seen a movie that feels more processed by a machine, a product for a content algorithm instead of anything approaching artistic intent or even an honest desire to entertain. And while there have been quality blockbusters produced by the Hollywood machine for generations (I miss those days), it feels like were increasingly reaching the point where they are so calculated and programmed that the human element is completely drained from them, making them as disposable as a fast food cheeseburger. Worst of all, that content approach is pulling the life from stars who have shown so much of it in the past. When the poster for Red Notice was released, most people lamented its Photoshopped, bland nature. They didnt realize how honestly it captured the movie.
Thurber, the director of Central Intelligence and Skyscraper (two movies I enjoyed enough on their own terms, for the record), reunites with his muse, Dwayne Johnson, who plays the FBIs top profiler John Hartley. The film opens with an awkwardly inserted info dump about three coveted eggs that were once the property of Cleopatra. Only two have been discovered, making the missing golden egg into a Holy Grail for treasure hunters, including one of the worlds most notorious criminals Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds). In the films relatively effective opening sequence, Hartley catches Booth trying to steal one of the eggs, inadvertently tying the two for the rest of the film into a classic buddy comedy dynamicthe muscle guy and the fast talker. They battle the authorities, a few bad guys, and another criminal mastermind nicknamed The Bishop (Gal Gadot) as they bounce around the world, trying to obtain all three eggs and sell them to the highest bidder.
Films like Raiders of the Lost Ark and National Treasure were clear inspirations on Red Notice but to say this movies lacks the identity of great action/adventure movies would be an understatement. Thurbers direction seems to have been simply to put Reynolds, Johnson, and Gadot on camera and allow their screen presence and familiar techniques to carry the story, and one can literally see the weight of that on their shoulders. Johnson has never been this wooden, unable to find the hero or everyman in a non-character. He needs to figure out what's next because he seems to be tired of parts like this one and he's too charismatic to convey tired for the next chapter of his career. Reynolds makes out a little better, but you can almost see him growing weary of his attempts at witty schtick as more of his attempts at humor thud than usual. It feels like everyone thought casting would be all it took to make Red Notice charming and then forgot to give their actors charming things to actually do. Oh, theres a lot of running and a lot of banter, but it starts to blend into cinematic paste."
ARL_Doc3_RedNotice,ARL,Comedy,Positive,Red Notice,"Lifting its title from Interpols most-wanted list, Dodgeball director Rawson Marshall Thurbers twisty treasure-hunt lark Red Notice blurs the lines between good guys and bad guys, and instead focuses on which of two notorious art thieves is better at breaking the law: sarcastic master forger Nolan Booth (a reliably whiny Ryan Reynolds) or his upscale nemesis, known only as the Bishop (a more wine-and-diney Gal Gadot).
Their goal is to collect three ornamental orbs  worth some $300 million, but only as a set  originally gifted from Anthony to Cleopatra, then scattered to the corners of the globe. While Booth and the Bishop ricochet around the world, engaging in what amounts to a high-stakes Easter egg hunt, criminal profiler John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) tries to bring them in, making for a fun, fast-paced and frequently amusing divertissement. Released by Netflix first in theaters Nov. 5, then streaming for subscribers a week later, Red Notice works surprisingly well for what it is.
The script, which Thurber wrote himself, sets off blazing, as Booth steals Cleopatras first egg, narrowly escaping Hartleys clutches, only to be apprehended when he arrives home in another hemisphere. Then the Bishop pops up, swipes the recovered prize, and lands Hartley in hot water, since the Interpol agent in charge, Inspector Das (Ritu Arya), now suspects the former FBI profiler of snagging it himself. Next thing Hartley knows, hes sharing a cell with Booth in some remote Russian prison.
Were squarely in 80s and 90s action-movie territory here, and Thurber (who took improbability to new heights with the Rock-starring Skyscraper) certainly knows how to deliver wild and well-choreographed fights, chases and other stunt-driven set-pieces. Take that first heist, when Booth runs through the museum, only to find himself cornered in a room with a giant metal scaffold, which he proceeds to unhook one pin at a time, until the whole thing comes crashing down. In so doing, Reynolds nimbly outwits his pursuers the way Jackie Chan might have back in the day.
The influence of Indiana Jones on Thurbers splashy travelogue is undeniable. Also channeled are retro favorites like James Camerons True Lies (including a sexy tango in which a big lug in a tuxedo  Johnson, not Schwarzenegger, in this case  makes himself irresponsibly conspicuous while undercover). Even more fun than the retro action is the old-fashioned dynamic between these three frenemies, who must cautiously agree to work together in order to locate all of Cleopatras eggs. Theres an unmistakable screwball-comedy quality to the repartee, as unlikely partners Booth and Hartley bicker, or anytime the Bishop shows up and upstages the other two.
Its been widely reported that on the Deadpool movies, Reynolds improvises (or otherwise comes prepared with) many of his jokes, and the snarky thief he plays here feels like an extension of irreverent cut-ups hes embodied before. Naturally, that attitude ruptures whatever reality audiences are supposed to buy into, but its worth it, since his zingers so often land (e.g., describing a targets always-watching, always-listening security as kinda like Alexa with guns, or tussling with Johnson, then dropping a perfectly timed, This is such a confusing erection).
Reynolds is one of the few contemporary leading men who can consistently get away with winking at the audience throughout a performance. Nearly everyone else in Hollywood is expected to act, or at least pretend to disappear into character. Along the same lines, no one buys Johnson as a mild-mannered FBI profiler (when Das tells him he doesnt look the part, he responds with an appropriately weary I get that a lot), but its satisfying to suspend disbelief and see what the Rock will do with the role. Meanwhile, Gadot, who was propelled to A-list status by Wonder Woman just a few years ago, gets to demonstrate that she has a sense of humor, too, as the Bishop teases and torments the others.
Her nickname hails from chess, though watching Red Notice feels more like a really good game of checkers, where the players keep things lively by jumping several of their opponents pieces in a single turn. These three are constantly outsmarting one another, such that Cleopatras eggs change hands often, while cuffs frequently bind the wrong wrists. Booth and Hartley are stuck together enough that they have no choice but to try getting along, as the now-framed fed breaks countless laws in order to clear his name, while a bromance slowly builds between them.
Thurber has a peculiar take on the morality of all this art theft. The first heist takes place in a museum, but the next two are presented as essentially victimless crimes. The second egg belongs to a notorious arms dealer named Sotto Voce (Chris Diamantopoulos), while the third is stashed away in a secret Nazi bunker packed with stolen artifacts, so theyre essentially fair game. Look for a box that says MacGuffin, quips Reynolds, citing Hitchcocks term for the otherwise-unimportant plot device that motivates a thriller. Once reunited, the three eggs dont conjure some all-powerful laser beam from the sky (thank goodness, as thats an even more tired clich), but instead serve as the ultimate wedding present to a profligate billionaires spoiled daughter  and theres a second surprise waiting to upstage the gift once the time comes.
Its all reasonably clever, so long as you dont scrutinize it too closely. Red Notice could be Thurbers spin on National Treasure, with just as much DNA from the RKO classic Gunga Din. The writer-director proves plenty adept at coming up with excuses for these characters to infiltrate and escape elaborately protected locations, and though the movie relies a bit too much on cumbersome exposition (the films first minutes are some of the clunkiest the genre has ever seen), it moves quickly enough that most audiences wont stumble into  or even stop to question  the plots many holes. Like a skilled con artist, the movie steals your time, but leaves you feeling like you got the more advantageous end of the deal.

ARL_Doc4_RedNotice,ARL,Comedy,Negative,Red Notice,"Three of the biggest movie stars in the world converge for one big action-adventure spectacular, enlivened by (reported) $20 million paychecks and the rare thrill of playing around with fellow titans. That setup makes the new film Red Notice (Netflix, November 12) sound like some project from the late 1990s, before IP became the selling point and actors more incidental. But it is indeed a film from and for the here and now. In that, Red Notice serves as a reminder that, well, they just dont make them like they used to.
The stars in question are Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot, all actors from the franchise world. The experiment of Rawson Marshall Thurbers film is to see if their respective styles can meld together into something that may kick off yet another franchise. Its an experiment that Netflix reportedly spent $200 million to run.
Alas, Red Notice is limp and dull, and does more to showcase the shortcomings of each of its marquee idols than it does to highlight their bankable charisma. A globe-trotting heist film that heavily relies on zippy banter, Red Notice never finds its groove, instead jerking around between familiar action sequences and humor that never lands.
Johnson plays FBI profiler John Hartley, whos tasked with preventing the theft of a priceless golden egg made by Marc Antony for his doomed love, Cleopatra. Hartley fails when the worlds greatest art thief, Reynoldss Nolan Booth, absconds with the thing. Theres another, perhaps better thief in the mix as well: Gadots The Bishop. And, as it turns out, there are a total of three missing eggs that need collecting. These objects dont have any magical, Ark of the Covenant-esque properties, but the Indiana Jones movies are nonetheless referenced in Red Notice, both in a Nazi-loot plotline and by Reynolds whistling a bit of John Williamss theme music. Red Notice would be better off not reminding us of far better things.
Its fitting that Reynolds should be the one to do the referencingas his character nods to lots of other old things, like Pulp Fiction and the way Borat says ""nice."" These irksome little non-jokes (Remember that thing??) aptly represent Reynoldss grating performance, a schtick thats seriously diminished in charm since Reynolds first trotted it out over 20 years ago. It feels lazy, like Reynolds is coasting on his Deadpool clout.
Johnson, once again playing the swaggering but gentle hulk, fares a bit better, because he is generally a more winsome performer. But theres still a halfhearted drag to his work here. Nothing in Marshall Thurbers script helps Johnson, or anyone else, rise to the occasion.
Gadot mostly just has to slink and sass and be smarter than the boys, doing a more wicked, but empty, riff on Diana Princes cool proficiency. She has discernible chemistry with neither Johnson nor Reynolds, who also have none with each another. Yet the movie is constantly telegraphing that were watching two icons bouncing off of one another, with surely dazzling results. Red Notice makes no effort to distinguish the characters that the actors are playing; it merely says, Look! Theyre in the same movie!
The films grim insistence that we are witnessing some seismic movie star coming-together makes one fret, a little, about the future of film iconography. Then again, available right now on Netflix (and, according to some early viewer data, playing like gangbusters there) is the gloriously invigorating Western The Harder They Fall. That film is loaded with starry swagger, its various heists and showdowns given effervescence by an ensemble of terrific, name-brand actors. Sure, that cast cant quite match the collective box office numbers of Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot. But maybe they should be given the chance to trywhile the members of the $20 million club go learn some badly needed new tricks.
"
ARL_Doc5_RedNotice,ARL,Comedy,Positive,Red Notice,"Only the greatest criminals in the world get a red notice, the official tag that Interpol slaps on you when you consistently break the law at a high level. The good news about Rawson Marshall Thurbers new film, also called Red Notice, is that this film critic wont be slapping a do not see tag on this action-adventure.
This is pure escapist fun, powered by star-driven lead actors. The organically-trained cinephile will argue that Dwayne The Rock Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot dont do much acting in Red Notice, but thats exactly the idea. This Netflix-funded production is the perfect bowl of Halloween adult-stolen candy on a Friday night where the brain gets turned off and the smile count goes up.
The plot revolves around Johnsons FBI profiler reluctantly teaming up with an art thief (Reynolds) to track down Cleopatras legendary eggs, the luscious pearl of the art world in Thurbers film. The only thing in their way is Gadots master criminal, who makes life hard for the wise-cracking duo. Hot on all three of their trails is Interpol (aka red notice stamper) Inspector Das (Ritu Arya). The locales start in Rome and race around the world, including stops in London and Argentina.
Much of what you expect to happen does indeed occur, but thats not the point. Escapist fun is rarely smart and doesnt carry much depth, but the nice thing here is that the humor outweighs the mindless action. Yes, there are car chases, fist fights, gun battles, and every other kind of genre quota-meeting attackbut the laughs are frequent and well-earned.
fter my chaotic morning, I turned this on and got lost in the craziness of it all. No human being could bounce off a brick roof, get electrocuted, punched and kicked a hundred times, and still manage to travel across the world in model-esque clothing. If you came to a movie where The Rock jumps off a poorly-constructed bridge-which is attached to a black site (for really bad people) prison-in the hopes of catching a moving helicopter in an extremely cold weather area for an award-caliber script, you reached the wrong room.
Red Notice is the epitome of tongue-in-cheek entertainment. This is the movie you watch after Remains of the Day for a palette cleanser. Thurbers script wont win a cinematic Pulitzer and the story is quite outlandish, but the roles in it are perfectly tailored for the stars talents.
Gadot, who is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, is known to most moviegoers as the heroic Wonder Woman, so seeing her play the official heel, aka the antagonist, is a surprising thrill. instead of being the hero pursuing the bad parties, its Gadot waiting for the boys to come to the yard. She relishes the opportunity to beat up on the gents, and it makes for a lot of easy laughs.
If Johnson is in the movie, just consider him a superhero in civilian clothing: someone who can jump out a window and crash through the awning of a shop straight onto a slab of concrete, and just bounce back like it was nothing. Or as Reynolds Booth refers to him at one point, a well-dressed wall. But Johnson also knows how to nail a witty line of dialogue and turn up the charisma in the blink of an eye.
His talents match up perfectly with Reynolds, Hollywoods class clown who is very much on cruise-control here. Thankfully, Reynolds cruise control is still a snarky line-delivering laugh machine. If you left Hobbs and Shaw wanting more of comedic interactions between Johnson and Reynolds, this movie will be a notice that one should be happy to receive.
I smiled a lot during the crisp and fast-moving 100-minute run time (minus the credits, where youre lighting a cigarette), and didnt feel like my time was wasted. Good timing too. Right before the trials and tribulations of depressing movies, aka awards season, can begin, some good old fashioned (if familiar and slight) pleasure is in order. Go elsewhere for anything accused of carrying depth. This is a fun room.

ARL_Doc6_RedNotice,ARL,Comedy,Negative,Red Notice,"A red notice, as helpfully defined by Red Notice, is the highest level of arrest warrant issued by Interpol. You might think of this detail as a red herring, given how little it really factors into the movies cheerfully hectic heist-caper plot. The title color, however, does get quite a workout: It pops up in the brilliant red gown Gal Gadot wears to a masquerade ball and in the red-ringed arena where Dwayne Johnson stares down a raging bull. And of course, it appears in the bright red Netflix logo that proudly kicks off the movie  the kind of noisily globe-trotting, tomb-raiding, rocket-launching entertainment that, a few years ago, would have been released by a traditional studio.
That was actually the plan in 2018, when Universal Pictures greenlit Red Notice on the strength of Johnsons attachment and presumably some hint of a premise (big guns, priceless artifacts, daddy issues  it writes itself). But a year later, before production began, the studio balked for widely speculated-about reasons: Maybe they finally took a look at writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurbers script, or maybe they were scared off by the (undeserved!) box office disappointment of Skyscraper, the previous Thurber-Johnson joint. Whatever the cause, Netflix snapped up the picture for more than $160 million, making it one of the costliest movies in the streamers history and dropping more than a few industry jaws.
That was all before the pandemic, which delayed the movies production and normalized the once-unthinkable prospect of pricey studio movies (like, say, Gadots Wonder Woman 1984) becoming predominantly streaming experiences. All of which makes the tediously cranked-up Red Notice only slightly more interesting as a movie-industry story involving enormous quantities of money than it is as a fictional story involving enormous quantities of money. One hundred sixty million dollars is a hefty sum (and probably a conservative estimate), but its dwarfed by the $300 million payday being chased by this movies trio of disreputables.
Johnson plays John Hartley, an FBI profiler whos set his sights on Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds), one of the worlds most wanted and obnoxiously deadpan art thieves. Soon theyre embroiled in a scheme centered on three bejeweled eggs once owned by Cleopatra, all of them now kept under lock and key in far-flung corners of the globe. Various sub-Dan Brown, sub-James Bond, sub-Indiana Jones shenanigans ensue: Windows shatter, scaffolding collapses and a brand spankin new Porsche lasts about five seconds into a not-so-thrilling chase in one of the movies better gags. The action leaps from a museum in Rome to a getaway in Bali to a prison in coldest Russia, which is where the no-nonsense agent and the wily thief go from reluctant cellmates to reluctant partners.
Forcing their hand with a mischievous wink is Booths archrival in crime, the Bishop (Gadot), who has an annoying talent for playing Booth and Hartley off each other while remaining several steps merrily ahead. This forced triangulation adds a too-faint crackle of sexual tension and a whole lot of lopsided banter, with Reynolds predictably dominating the wisecracks while his co-stars have the general good sense not to even try keeping up. The miscast Gadot finds herself at a particular disadvantage. Whether shes mocking a trussed-up intelligence analyst or applying electroshock paddles to Johnsons nether-regions, she confirms  much as her luminously earnest Wonder Woman performances already suggested  that winking cynicism isnt her strong suit.
Johnson, a deft performer with a gift for self-mockery, fares somewhat better. As in Thurbers delightfully dumb-but-not-so-dumb Central Intelligence, he finds himself cast as the bigger, buffer side in a rambunctious action-comedy bromance; in that movie, however, he and Kevin Hart both played against type and struck on a surprisingly fresh, counterintuitive dynamic. Johnson and Reynolds arent the worst action duo  theyre both good at dangling from roof railings  but their odd-couple bit is thin and predictable by comparison. Reynolds basically sits there shooting off his mouth, rattling off up-to-the-minute references to Instagram and Post Malone, while Johnson responds with mostly stony silence, his facial muscles occasionally stretching the short distance from exasperated to unimpressed.
Put another way: Reynolds is there to mock and deconstruct the plot (Look for a box that says MacGuffin, he notes during a particularly dull stretch of the egg hunt), while Johnson and Gadot are on hand to earnestly recap it. And some recapping is admittedly helpful, given how busily Thurber piles on the narrative fake-outs and tedious side characters, including an Interpol killjoy (Ritu Arya) and a shirtless arms dealer (Chris Diamantopoulos)  all en route to an ending so inane that the characters seem faintly embarrassed to have to go along with it. A depressing reminder of what Hollywood considers original material these days, Red Notice plays one of those self-consciously convoluted, ultimately derivative long cons that strain so hard to seem breezily insouciant they wind up wearing you out. By the end, its the clichs that warrant a rest.
"
ARL_Doc7_RedNotice,ARL,Comedy,Positive,Red Notice,"To get by in this crazy world of ours, you typically need some sort of skill, be that innate or learned and trained into existence. But to excel, you usually need to add in a heaping dose of charisma, especially if the said skill is to create a raving fan base that will buy more of you and whatever service or product you might be selling. 
Muhammad Ali was no doubt a great boxer, but what made him so memorable was his charisma. Politicians know this and use that to their advantage to gain followers who will vote for them. And Hollywood actors and actresses know that you can make a good living being talented, but to be a movie star you need a certain ""it"" factor, a.k.a. charisma. 
That's an attribute that will get butts in seats, be that in the theater or at home, and most any new release needs at least one performer with that quality to ensure some degree of success. Of course, two would be even better, and having three charismatic performers in one movie would be, well, the holy cinematic trifecta. 
The 2001 remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" had that in spades -- sorry, couldn't resist throwing in a little card reference to the casino heist flick -- and while it's not as excellent as that offering, the crime caper based, action-comedy ""Red Notice"" has some serious star power. 
The film was originally intended to be released by Universal in the summer of 2020, but we all know how such pre-pandemic plans ultimately played out. Now debuting on Netflix, the flick features three of the biggest stars working in movies today -- Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot -- and if there's ever been a film that could at minimum get by on the collective charisma of its cast, this would be the latest poster child for that. 
Which is a good thing as the nearly two-hour-long movie otherwise feels derivative of various predecessors, something the flick occasionally acknowledges in a very transparent, meta way. For example, at one point, Reynolds' character starts whistling a familiar-sounding tune -- from a certain Harrison Ford archaeology flick -- as this pic veers into quite similar territory in the third act. 
Yes, stolen art is the driving force behind this film from writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber. But long before the WWII-era Nazi elements show up, the film goes for the more generic -- but still slickly choreographed and shot -- storyline of a museum heist. It revolves around FBI profiler John Hartley (Johnson) arriving at a Rome museum with Interpol agent Urvashi Das (Ritu Arya) to thwart infamous art thief Nolan Booth (Reynolds) from stealing an ancient Egyptian egg art piece formerly owned by none other than Cleopatra. 
Not surprisingly, the bad guy gets away with the piece, only to have it stolen by an even more accomplished art thief known only as The Bishop (Gadot) who then sets up the FBI agent to appear to be the bad guy. That results in Oscar and Felix, um, Hartley and Booth ending up as unlikely roommates -- okay, cellmates if you have to be accurate -- who must then reluctantly work together to thwart their diagonal moving adversary. 
All of which results in big action set pieces, globetrotting to various locales, another villain (Chris Diamantopoulos as an arms dealer with the second out of three eggs and a Napoleon-type height complex), and Johnson and Reynolds essentially playing similar versions to other characters they've previously inhabited. At least Gadot plays against her typical character type (and has obvious fun doing so), but like her cohorts brings her instantly identifiable acting style to the part. 
While those looking for any semblance of originality will be hard-pressed to find one iota of it here, the film ends up coming off like tasty comfort food in that you know what you're getting, it all goes down easily, and you'll likely feel satisfied after consuming it. Throw in a heaping helping of star power charisma, and ""Red Notice"" earns a 6 out of 10 rating. 
"
ARL_Doc8_RedNotice,ARL,Comedy,Negative,Red Notice,"Once upon a time in Hollywood: People realized that people in movies would make people go to the movies. Not just anybody  certain people. People who had that thing, that indescribable quality that made film cameras love them and audiences love them even more. They settled on calling them movie stars, suggesting something that would burn blindingly bright then either flame out or fade to black. When you were lucky enough to get a Clara or a Chaplin, a Marilyn or a Marlon, a Clooney and a Julia, you knew what you were getting. Some of them were versatile actors; for others, the concept of range barely even mattered. Maybe they were playing a starlet, or a blind surgeon, or a cop who has to make a choice, or a migrant farm worker who sees the face of God in a potato. It did not matter. You went to see them, or rather them, a screen persona blown up to IMAX-sized proportions.
Then a funny thing happened. (Gather round, children, Grandpa is telling a story.) Movie stars became something closer to comets, arcing through the sky with an increasing rarity. Some still roamed the red-carpeted Earth, gracing magazine covers [cough, cough] and fulfilling our needs for archetypes. By the 21st century, however, it was becoming harder to sell and sustain the whole shebang. Two terrible, horrible, no-good, very-bad opening weekends, and sayonara. Even all-star projects began to feel a little threadbare: Only a third of the Oceans Eleven crew technically qualify as being above-the-title names. And the few that occupied that second tier of the A-list migrated to television.
Now, intellectual properties  there was something you could count on! You could sell tickets to those types of movies everywhere. You could replace actors who were difficult to handle, because whoever was behind the mask didnt matter as much as the mask itself. You might even use them to mint something close to a star by proxy. Most people might not have known who Chris Evans was a decade ago. But they can tell you who played Captain America now.
Should you love movies and still cling to the wobbly notion that stardom is part of the package, its tempting to wonder who they would have cast in Red Notice during different eras. Trust us: You will need a fun distraction to get through this threadbare, throwback attempt at a celebrity-driven caper. Theres a world in which Burt Lancaster is the FBIs top criminal profiler, Jerry Lewis is an internationally wanted jewel thief and Audrey Hepburn is a mysterious femme fatale known as Bishop. Or close your eyes, and drop Sylvester Stallone, John Belushi and Faye Dunaway into those roles, all of them chasing each other around the world over three priceless golden eggs that once belonged to Cleopatra. How about making Clint Eastwood, Eddie Murphy and Demi Moore jump out of stained-glass windows, engage in high-speed chases and lounge around on yachts? Really, the idea behind this lazy blockbuster-by-numbers is that you could throw any three famous people into some wonky, generic mash-up of Bond thrillers, buddy comedies, heist flicks, and Raiders of the Lost Ark outtakes and youd still get the same diminishing returns. (We also realize there are worst-case scenarios here as well, and while we can forgive, we must never forget.)
There are extremely slim pickings for a 2021 iteration of this, which is why you get One of the Last Genuine Movie Stars Standing (Dwayne Johnson), a Very Handsome Smart-ass Who Can Also Open a Film (Ryan Reynolds) and an International Sensation Who Kicks Ass in Evening Gowns (Gal Gadot) globetrotting between Bali and Rome and Cairo, trading quips and looking great in expensive casual wear and doing everything but wink at the audience. The fact that two of them became mega-famous thanks to comic-book franchises  and the third is about to join the DC Universe, though years of pro-wrestling and a key part in the Fast & Furious flicks basically meant Johnson was doing superhero-movie duty already  gives you a good idea of how the system works now. Honestly, we applaud the restraint Netflix showed by not slapping the tagline Deadpool and Wonder Woman Drive Hobbs Bananas! on this and selling it that way.
In the past, this might have been a huge summer tentpole movie, given the sort of Planet-Hollywood-photo-shoot-writ-large premiere that suggested gods still walked among us. Now, its merely more Content, something to stream between finishing that dystopian South Korean satire and starting a new season of The Great British Baking Show. Everyone involved seems to understand that this is how Red Notice  which stands for Interpols highest most-wanted classification, a fact that now seems ironic given the quality of the product at hand  will be consumed. So, yknow, just show up and do your thing, guys, and give the people on the couch what you think they want from you. Dwayne, youre a compelling screen performer, so in between rehashing action scenes from better multiplex fodder, feel free tosimply stand there and look stern? Maybe give folks the side-eye occasionally? Ryan, dial up that aint-a-stinker act to 100, and lace every single line with weapons-grade snark. Gal, do whatever it is you do  tilt your head? look like youre about to scold some kids?  when youre not deflecting bullets with Amazonian bracelets. Dont worry about plot points or WTF last-minute twists or why somebody is where or who these characters are or that this somehow all seems familiar but wrong in every possible way. Go be movie stars in exotic locales, but without all the fun that entails.
Ok, what, were supposed to just lap all of this up and be thankful writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber can swoop a camera? (Having been granted a permanent hall pass for giving the world Dodgeball, this particular test of your tolerance for duck-shit-slick moviemaking suggests its time to revoke it.) Theres something incredibly deflating about all of this, from the waste of precious screen-talent resources to the sense that youre watching the last gasp of an age-old formula. It is like staring at a bright, shiny epitaph for two hours. We may not be able to make magnificent movie stars by the dozens anymore. But we can sure as fuck make better movie-star movies than this.
"
ARL_Doc9_RedNotice,ARL,Comedy,Positive,Red Notice,"Red Notice is entertaining action comedy. Itd be hard for a movie featuring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds to be boring,
Still, its difficult not to feel a little disappointed knowing this trio could be capable of so much more. This is the potential straight A student settling for Bs simply because it requires less work. It still gets the job done but the payoff could be even greater. Maybe with the sequel?
FBI agent John Hartley (Johnson, Jungle Cruise) is tracking down renowned art thief Nolan Booth (Reynolds, Free Guy). Booth is targeting the legendary three ceremonial eggs Marc Anthony gifted his lover Cleopatra.
Hartley teams with Interpol agent Urvashi Das (Ritu Arya, Umbrella Academy) to eventually bring Booth into custody.
Neither counted on the other top art thief, The Bishop (Gal Gadot, Zack Snyders Justice League) to snatch the first egg and frame Hartley for stealing the egg for himself. Imprisoned with Booth, Hartleys only chance of clearing his name is by teaming up to catch The Bishop and retrieve the eggs. 
Johnson plays his standard Dwayne Johnson role when matched up with a hyper talkative funny guy. This has proven to be a major moneymaker for Johnson who exudes plenty of charisma so its not a one man show. In this case, swap Kevin Hart for Reynolds.
Reynolds is playing the normal Ryan Reynolds action comedy role. No knock as few can people off his style of breezy sarcasm so effortlessly and amusing. Its probably just a weird coincidence that Reynolds gets in a dig on Johnsons former Fast and Furious co-star
Gadot is the one largely playing against type and seems to be having a blast as the bad girl always a step ahead of her rivals. Whether singing or vamping it up as a femme fatale, Gadot is a lot of fun.
Director/screenwriter Rawson Marshall Thurber (Were the Millers, Skyscraper) sets up some extravagant action pieces including a perilous escape from a snow covered prison involving a bazooka shootout on a rope bridge, a close quarters fight in an art exhibit, a high speed chase in a tunnel and even a bull fight. No word on if it was a Brahma Bull though.
In the first action sequence, Booth shows off his parkour skills, which largely stay dormant the rest of the film. Its an odd decision as the heavy movement based style of elusion fits Booths character more than trying to mimic Hartleys tank-like approach to fighting.
Thurber juggles his three leads well giving them ample spotlights of their own to showcase their skills. Playing to his casts strengths shouldnt be a bad thing yet occasionally it feels like Thurber could have played against expectations more with Johnson and Reynolds.
Theyre not exactly challenging themselves with these roles. Gadots performance shows there was some potential in doing something different than the norm.
This starts to weigh the film down somewhat  aided no doubt by its excessive two hour run time. Theres not enough meat on this premise to drag it out for two hours. Stripped down to 90 or even 100 minutes and the film would have been far more effective.
Early on, Thurber establishes a who can you trust? dynamic allowing for some fun double crosses and teases of larger betrayals. It keeps the plot unpredictable and the payoff very uncertain.
Johnson, Gadot and Reynolds play off each other extremely well and this seems like an obvious blockbuster sequel candidate for Netflix. A second installment could work out some of the earlier kinks and further the adventures of this likable, if somewhat underachieving trio."
ARL_Doc10_RedNotice,ARL,Comedy,Negative,Red Notice,"Rawson Marshall Thurbers Red Notice is the cinematic equivalent of a blandly competent cover band cranking out perfunctory versions of hits you know by heart. With sequences lifted wholesale from everything from Face/Off to The Thomas Crown Affair, the film is so bereft of original ideas that it almost starts to play as a winking genre mashup, something like what Kill Bill might look like if Quentin Tarantino was more into Jerry Bruckheimer and Steven Spielberg than Sergio Corbucci and the Shaw Brothers.
During a scene that cribs from Raiders of the Lost Ark, one character starts whistling the Indiana Jones theme music. Its a nod to the audience that the filmmakers know how obvious their genre-thieving is, but such gestures come off less as gleeful winks than resigned shrugs. And despite its massive budget, top-tier stars, and state-of-the-art special effects, Red Notice aspires to be nothing more than flavorless sludge to be compacted and compartmentalized by Netflixs marketing algorithms. It can be sold, variously, as a buddy action-comedy for those who enjoyed the Lethal Weapon series, a heist thriller with a strong female lead, or a rollicking National Treasure-style adventure. Its all of these things and none of them at the same time, an assemblage of borrowed parts that never integrate into a coherent whole.
Dwayne Johnson stars as hotshot F.B.I. profiler John Hartley, whos working the international art-heist beat, chasing after dueling thieves Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) and a shadowy operative known only as the Bishop (Gal Gadot). Booth and the Bishop are seeking three ancient bejeweled eggs, gifts from Mark Antony to Cleopatra, which have been scattered across the globe over the intervening centuries. An Egyptian billionaire, Abanoub Magdy (Ethan Herschenfeld), has offered up a handsome sum to anyone who can deliver all three eggs, which are to be given to his daughter, also named Cleopatra (Brenna Marie Narayan), as a wedding gift. Globetrotting hijinks ensue, taking the central trio to a Roman museum, a Russian prison, a Spanish villa, an abandoned Argentine copper mine, and beyond.
When Hartleys accused of stealing one of the eggs by Interpol, hes forced to team up with the wisecracking Booth in a marriage of convenience that finds them busting each others chops and double-crossing each other at every turn. Theres a Hope-and-Crosby Road picture begging to burst forth from the films three-way character dynamic, with Reynolds filling the wiseass Hope role, Johnson as the Crosby-like straight man, and Gadot as an ass-kicking update on Dorothy Lamours typically thankless romantic-interest part. But despite the films prodigious ball-busting repartee, the three leads never really ease into a groove.
Reynoldss rote smart-aleck schtick grows increasingly strained as the film wears on, while Johnsons surprisingly dour performance is uncharacteristically charmless with his usual twinkling charisma apparent only in the films final stretch. Gadot chews her scenes with relish, but her character is too ill-defined to provide much for her to sink her teeth into.
Unlike the Road films, whose threadbare plots ambled along with no hint of urgency, making plenty of time for a song-and-dance number here and some improv-heavy riffing there, Thurbers script is fixated on keeping things moving. Our characters have scarcely arrived in some new exotic locale before some loopy plot complication or gratuitous action sequence has thrust them along to the next. The film, then, goes down easy enough. It may not be clever or original, but at least it doles out amusingly asinine plot twists with clockwork-like regularity.
Red Notice rarely goes more than 20 minutes without some explosion, foot chase, or a little hand-to-hand combat, but all this action feels as mechanical and uninspired as the rest of its moving parts. Scenes that should simmer with gonzo energy, such as a prison escape that devolves into a miniature military battle in which a missile flies through the open doors of a helicopter, simply coast on by, barely leaving an impact on the viewer. Thurber at least has a penchant for digitally-assisted effects in which the camera appears to dart through windows and dive off cliffs, which lend these otherwise blandly utilitarian action sequences a sense of dynamism. But therein lies the films fundamental problem: A constant sense of motion cant obscure how stale, secondhand, and spiritless this entire endeavor feels."
AAV_Doc1_TheMartian,Abhilash Ashok Velaan,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Martian,"NASA's discovery of water on the surface of Mars would have been warmly welcomed by the protagonist in The Martian, a stranded astronaut who ends up having to cook up his own, and grow spuds with the assistance of his own excrement. Though set mainly on the red planet, The Martian is not so much a sci-fi adventure as a story of survival, ingenuity and that indomitability of spirit we humans seem to admire so much in ourselves.

Directed by Ridley Scott and based on a novel by Andy Weir, the film is set in the not-too-distant future and stars Matt Damon as Mark Watney, a scientist and astronaut who's part of a manned mission to Mars. He, his captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and four colleagues are kidding about on the intercom as they search the planet's surface for scientific data when a huge dust storm suddenly hits, prompting Lewis to order an immediate departure before their ship is fatally damaged.

On the way back to it, Watney is struck by a large piece of debris, and sent careering off into the dust. All communication with him is lost, he's presumed dead, and the crew leave without him. But Mark is not dead, and wakes the next morning to find the planet becalmed and his colleagues nowhere in sight. He returns to the crew's base, repairs a wound to his stomach, and takes stock.

As Earth is 225 million kilometres away, direct communication is not possible, and Mark's initial calculations offer a gloomy prognosis. With only enough food to last him 30 days, he'll be dead in a month, alone and forgotten and with only his captain's appalling disco compilations to keep him company. Then, he realises that the oxygenated hub actually holds supplies for six people, which if combined and rationed, could last him years.

Also, Mark is a botanist, and decides to try and grow his own potatoes using Marian soil, poo-poo and water created by burning hydrazine.

If all of that works, and he does survive long enough, Watney plans to travel 3,000 kilometres to the Schiaparelli crater, where another manned mission to the planet is due to land in four years. But there's a problem: his space rover is powered by a battery that needs recharging every 35 kilometres, so Mark will have to concoct a radical new way of powering it. Meanwhile, back on Earth, NASA has realised he's alive after noticing movement on their satellite images. NASA chairman Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) has already announced his death, and even held a funeral for him, but as news of Mark's survival grows he becomes an international cause celebre, and Sanders and his scientists work desperately to find a way of beating the odds and saving him.

Basically, then, Mark Watney is Robinson Crusoe in a spacesuit, and The Martian also reminds one of Robert Zemeckis's Castaway. But while Tom Hanks lost his reason and started baring his soul to a volleyball, Watney seems to treat his isolation on a hostile planet millions of miles from home as a minor inconvenience, and rarely do we see him succumb to anger or despair.

Instead he problem-solves his way through long days and nights on the freezing, dusty planet, rarely losing sight of his ultimate goal and never giving up or becoming despondent. If this relentless positivism is hard to believe, it's worth recalling that we are watching a Hollywood movie, and a hugely entertaining one at that. Matt Damon is as winning as ever as the resourceful and dryly humorous astronaut, and Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean and Chiwetel Ejiofor play NASA types who shift heaven and Earth to save him.

Jordan's deserts stand in for Mars, and Ridley Scott handles the planetary and space sequences beautifully, especially an action-packed climax that will have you on the edge of your seat."
AAV_Doc2_TheMartian,Abhilash Ashok Velaan,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Martian,"The subtitle to Ridley Scotts The Martian could very well be: Science, Hell Yeah!

The film is pro-science in the way that a sports movie about the rag-tag underdog team that wins the big game is pro sports. The film doesnt just love science, its sentimental about its love for science. It wants everyone who watches the film to love scienceor more accurately, scientistsas much as it does. And I have to say, the idea that some budding young engineerperhaps a kid in a NASA T-shirt somewhere in Texasis going to see this film and get stars in his or her eyes got me a little misty.

Lest you think the film is all brains, no action, please remember that its directed by the guy who brought us Gladiator. The film is absolutely thrillingand it doesnt waste any time before getting down to business. Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is on a mission to explore Mars, along with his fellow crewmembers and his commander, Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain). A deadly storm takes a sudden turn and touches down and, as the crew scrambles to get back on the ship, Watney is struck by a piece of hurling debris. The blow is bad enough that it likely killed himand with the ferocious wind and flying red dust, Lewis cant see anything. She has two choices: Risk her entire crew by searching for a man who is probably already dead or leave without him. Reluctantly, she decides to leave. But, of course, Watney is not dead. He wakes up with a punctured space suit and no space ship, aloneon Mars.

There is, however, a space station, filled with about a years worth of food and cubbies containing a few minor personal effects for each of the astronauts (including Lewiss mixed CDs of 70s disco, one of the films few overly-played-out jokes). But Watney knows that it might take months for NASA to figure out hes alive and then as many as four years before they could possibly come back to retrieve him. A space botanist, hes going to have to create his own food supplyseemingly impossible on a planet where nothing grows and theres no water.* Watney, who has been videotaping his time alone on Mars for both an accurate record of his survival and to keep himself from going mad, turns to the camera: Im going to have to science the shit out of this, he says.

Thats the best line in the film, and it also perfectly captures the films ethos. Because its not just Watney who needs to science the shit out of things. Back at NASA, once they figure out that Watney is alive (a satellite camera trained to the planet picked up on his movements), an accelerated rescue mission needs to be coordinated. Basically, things that normally take years to do now must be done in months, even weeks. And then the question emerges: Should they tell the surviving members of the crew, who are still months away from returning to earth, that Watney is alive?

One of the many things I like about The Martian: There are no bad guys. In most films of this type, thered be some whispered resistance to bringing Watney home. After all, theyd already held a beautiful public memorial service for him, why not just leave him up there? But this is not that kind of film. Everyone wants to get Watney back and for the right reasons; they simply have slightly different agendas. Jeff Daniels, playing the director of NASA, wants to do whats best for the agency going forward. Kristen Wiig, playing NASAs director of PR, wants to put the best public spin on things. Sean Bean, as a kind of liaison to the astronauts, wants to keep Watneys fellow crewmembers apprised of all the developments. And Chewetel Ejiofor, as the director of Mars operations, is bound by both his duty to NASA and his duty to the crew.

Theres more fun science: The always-welcome Donald Glover plays a young astrophysicista kind of rumpled, distracted, genius typewho devises a plan to rescue Watney, thats either totally brilliant or totally insane. (Of course Im not going to tell you which.)

Better still: The astronauts and physicists are a wonderfully, casually diverse bunch. Glover and Ejiofor are black. Michael Pena, whos Hispanic, plays one member of Watneys original crew. The lead rocket scientist (Benedict Wong) is a Chinese-American, and the Chinese space program is instrumental in assisting Watneys rescue mission. The ships commander is a woman, as is one more crew member (Kate Mara), plus a digital expert back at home (Mackenzie Davis).

Screenwriter Drew Goddard, working off Andy Weirs beloved novel, does a great job of keeping us engaged with what happens on the ground, but we spend most of our time alone, with Watney. At one point, in a sort of awed voice, Watney notes that everything he does on Mars is a first: First to walk here. First to see this. First to grow something there.

Even once he manages to grow potatoes in a kind of makeshift greenhouse, his odds are survival are slim, and he knows this. But he just solves one problem at a time. Thats all he can do. Damon is great in this part, relying on his natural charisma and lightening-quick smarts to keep us engaged with Watneys every thought,his every mood swing. A few critics have objected to Watneys impish sense of humor throughout his ordealit certainly makes the science-y parts more funbut I bought it. If youre a funny person, youre funny in a crisis. Also, Watneys sense of humor is probably what kept him alive.

Im the least mechanically inclined person alive, so I have no idea if the science in The Martian is accurate. It sure felt accurate, which is all that matters in a way. On top of being wildly entertaining, the film is about using your wits to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. In a country that often values feats of strength more than feats of intelligence, thats something to cheer about, indeed.

*Okay, so it turns out theres water."
AAV_Doc3_TheMartian,Abhilash Ashok Velaan,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Martian,"The Martian is the story of a man in trouble and in desperate need of saving. Brilliant and resourceful, he must marshal all of his creative powers to solve a series of difficult problems or all is lost. That man is Ridley Scott.

The Oscar-nominated British director has been mired in a late-career slump after a run of middling films that only served to dent his legacy, namely The Counselor, Prometheus, and Exodus: Gods and Kings. Scott, at the OMG age of 77, can still put together a movie, but fans have been wondering if he had any greatness left in him. The Martian answers that question with a pleasantly enthusiastic yes.

That enthusiasm comes tempered as we wonder if Scott would have approached The Martian in the same manner had he made it 30 years ago, instead of giving us something so uncharacteristically light and optimistic. Sure, theres plenty of disarming humor and even glibness in Andy Weirs 2011 self-published novel  which shares its basic premise with Byron Haskins 1964 still-good sci-fier Robinson Crusoe on Mars  but the novel is also a gripping, hard-science survival story.

In the book, NASA astronaut Mark Watney is left for dead on Mars after the rest of his Ares 3 crew is forced to evacuate the planet during a dust storm. Watney, the ships botanist, must find a way to survive for upwards of four years until he can be rescued.

The material would seem a perfect match for a director who can turn the screws with the best of them. (Alien, his 1979 masterpiece, has lost none of its creepy-crawly power.) And Weirs tale has enough tension, despair, adventure, mystery, and scares to become a touchstone sci-fi adventure picture. Scott, however, had other plans. And they include disco. Lots of disco.

While its comforting to know that Gloria Gaynor will be appreciated by subsequent generations, The Martians greatest strength is maintaining as much of the novels rigorous fealty to science as possible. Although the film takes place in an unspecified future, screenwriter Drew Goddard makes sure Watneys plan for surviving on a planet with no breathable atmosphere or potable water hews to credible scholarship.

In voice over and video diaries, Watney articulates the process of cataloguing his remaining food, creating water (using hydrazine rocket fuel, duh!), and using the crews waste to fertilize rows of potatoes. He also dismantles various pieces of equipment to attempt contact with Earth and learns that Vicodin makes a decent substitute for ketchup.

Calling these scenes MacGyver-esque is reductive. They are inspiringly unapologetic tributes to resourcefulness and ingenuity. And making the science go down easier is Matt Damons everyman charm. This is not Jason Bourne on Mars. This is Damon as the very personification of American can-do spirit at its most manifest.

Indeed, at times The Martian even comes across as too blithe. While NASA certainly prefers astronauts who dont panic under pressure, Watneys humor and sarcasm makes the process so relaxed that the stakes, while always present and consistently absorbing, fail to seem insurmountable.

The Martian also posits an idealistic future where NASA is not only still around, but operating in gleaming towers containing lots of fancy monitors. Inside those towers and staring intently at those monitors are various well-chosen character actors, including Jeff Daniels as NASA chief, Chiwetel Ejiofor as the mission director, and Kristen Wiig as a PR rep. Their brows furrow and the corners of their mouths turn downward as they worriedly consider the latest logistical, monetary, or PR difficulty. And they maintain military-grade calm as rescue missions fail and deadlines are blown. (It always seems to enhance a sci-fi movies credibility when characters devote precious screen time to executing an idea that doesnt end up working.)

Even if these Earthbound scenes occasionally have a certain box-checking stiffness, its just too refreshing to see a science-fiction movie (or any movie for that matter) where smart characters are presented with intriguing problems and then must talk out their solutions.

Less authentic is the double-barreled bootlick to the movies target audiences: two late-innings heroes are the youthful nerd (Donald Glover, a little too broad), who demonstrates his lifesaving plan using a stapler and, of course, the Chinese, who save the day by booking the film in their theaters  I mean, by providing a booster rocket for NASAs rescue attempt.

Meanwhile, the rest of the Watney-less mission crew drifts back to Earth, led by a guilt-ridden Jessica Chastain. Other than giving Watney a chance to articulate his process and his feelings to the audience, the ships crew (which also includes Kate Mara, Michael Pea, and Sebastian Stan) just hangs around until forced to make its Big Decision, which results in a sub-Gravity climax that feels more science fiction than science.

The Martian isnt as nail-biting as Apollo 13 or as angst-ridden as Cast Away. It wasnt written that way by Andy Weir and it wasnt directed that way by Ridley Scott. Instead, its a neatly packaged, mainstream space adventure and its a good one. That lump you feel in your throat as Times Square fills with those gathering to witness Watneys ultimate fate might be our response to the movies buried message: that an increasingly fractured America hasnt lost its ability to put aside political and social differences and to come together as a nation to save one of its countrymen.

If that leads to a willful disregard for the bleakness and despair inherent in Watneys journey in favor of something more optimistic, theres nothing wrong with that. Actually, its rather exhilarating. In an era of look at me CGI fireworks, heres a movie with a lets work together emphasis on problem-solving and teamwork. Pity thats become such an alien concept."
AAV_Doc4_TheMartian,Abhilash Ashok Velaan,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Martian,"How long would you survive on a desert island? Most of us wouldnt outlast our iPhone batteries. Thats why we love movies where intrepid can-do guys are stranded in harsh conditions and make a go of it with just a pocket knife, a gum wrapper and a frazzled shoelace.

Such a man is Mark Watney (Matt Damon), stranded on Mars after his ship departs, his crewmates thinking him dead. (Not their fault, hes the first to point out.) , And Mars is even worse than your average desert island, where you can at least breath the air and enjoy a seafood diet.

Hes not wholly without resources. The crew left a base camp equipped with oxygen and food that was supposed to last the five of them a month. But the next ship isnt headed his way for at least four years.

The Martian could have been called Robinson Crusoe on Mars if that title hadnt already been taken, back in 1964. That was a pretty good movie, but science has come a long way, so the world is due for an update.

At its best, which is the first half of the movie, The Martian gives us exactly what weve come to see: Details of a can-do guy doing. That Watney is a botanist helps when it comes to finding more food. Having a passing knowledge of physics and chemistry also proves useful, as science teachers around the world will be glad to see.

Watney is also an upbeat, optimistic kind of guy, or at least thats how Damon plays him. You just cant help but root for him.

You dont ever stop rooting for him, but the spell of the opening scenes fades away. The novel by Andy Weir from which it was adapted is no ones idea of great literature, but its crammed with details: reading it makes you feel that if you were dropped on Mars with a copy of it, youd be able to get by. Even better, it makes you feel that any problem can be solved if you just apply some rigorous reasoning to itif you just, as Watney says, science the shit out of it.

But books are books and movies are movies, and they dont play by the same rules. The novel was adapted by Drew Goddard, who has given us such logically wobbly films as The Cabin in the Woods and World War Z. Any hope you have that The Martian might be a science fiction version of Cast Away disappears about halfway through when it cops an attitude  of, OK, thats enough MacGyver stuff, lets get on to the standard plot about how were going to rescue this guy.

I dont mean to be spoiling anything here, but there are only two ways this movie can go: (1) Watney learns to love a solitary life on Mars, or (2) Watney gets rescued. I would love to see the first movie, but I wasnt expecting it. And once it becomes clear that this is going the second routewhich happens far too early in the proceedingsit stops being interested in Watneys survival efforts and concentrates on lots of actors playing stressed out NASA guys. Which weve all seen before. (Though if you have to have this kind of stuff, its fun to see it done by a cast that includes Jeff Daniels (essentially reprising The Newsrooms Will McAvoy), Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, and Sean Bean.)

It was directed by Ridley Scott, whose reputation as a thinking mans science fiction director rests on work that is more than three decades oldBlade Runner, Alien. Once the film moves away from the tight focus on one mans struggle for survival, it becomes lumpy and erratic, lurching from scene to scene as Scott seems to lose interest in anything but making the spaceships look cool.

Im probably being too harsh. For a nights worth of entertainment, its pretty decent stuff, especially coming after a summer of brainless comic book movies. But The Martian is its own worst enemy: the good stuff at the beginning makes the run-of-the-mill stuff seem worse than it is."
AAV_Doc5_TheMartian,Abhilash Ashok Velaan,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Martian,"Amongst the many memorable moments that occur during director Ridley Scotts new film The Martian, is one particularly moving episode that perfectly illustrates that the director gets it and that his film has been constructed with loads of loving care and meticulous attention to detail.

The scene involves a rather innocuous visual montage of survival preparations by stranded martian astronaut, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), as he formulates a plan to survive on the inhospitable alien planet. As is always the case with movie montages, an appropriate song plays over the action emphasizing the emotional impact of the scene.

But in this case, the scene is enhanced by what might be the least expected song but results in one of the most greatly appreciated moments of the entire film  as understated as it is. No, its not Elton Johns Rocket Man, Steve Millers Space Cowboy, or even David Bowies Space Oddity. Those would be too obvious. I wont spoil it for you here, but lets just say youd need to go way down on your list of possible candidates. The moment is just one of many in Scotts outstanding adventure that, not coincidentally, also happens to be based on some very sound science theories.

As the film opens, we join Watney and his 5 crew mates on the red planet during their 18th Martian day (known as Sols) as a particularly ferocious storm is approaching. All hell breaks loose and through a series of unfortunate incidents, Watney is left behind, presumed dead by his commander, Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain). Lewis and her crew, including mission pilot Rick Martinez (Michael Pea), tech specialist Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), and chemist Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie), are now faced with the guilt of leaving a fallen comrade behind, and are in a very dark place as they face many months of travel to get back home to Earth.

In the meantime, as NASA scientists peruse their satellite images of the martian surface, they notice activity and movement around the abandoned pressurized canvas living structure (known as a Hab). The activity is coming from Watney who apparently survived the ordeal and finds himself stranded on the surface of Mars. With only meager supplies meant to last a crew of six for 68 sols, he must draw upon his ingenuity and spirit to find a way to make his rations last for 400 sols and to let Earth know he is alive.

What initially feels like the makings of a story about depravation, starvation, and the creeping ravages of cabin fever that all lead to an eventual death (after all, help is a few years and a few million miles away), is instead the ultimate survival story about how we humans must respond to unimaginable duress and isolation with grace and determination.

Watneys coping device is his wit and self-deprecating humor in the face of impossible odds as he records his dealings and state of mind on a video log for posterity. His perfectly balanced humor is also a much-welcomed bit of relief for us from the actions near-relentless intensity. His witty zingers give us insight into his emotional state and invincible spirit to survive against insurmountable odds. Its also a pretty cool way of providing an active voice-over to fill us in on the complexities of the science involved with his survival.

The films friendly and approachable tone comes from Andy Weirs novel that originated as an online serial and $1 amazon buy but was eventually picked up by a major publisher. Screenwriter Drew Goddard strips the nerdy tech-talk (Weir was originally a computer programmer), leaves the meticulously researched science and math, and winds up with a brilliantly sculpted speculative fiction piece that inspires us about human nature, gives a perfect demonstration of the importance of humor in the face of adversity, and hopefully inspires some of the youngsters about the importance of science.

Though Damon captivates us with his one-man show in the films first third, we get frequent breaks from the Mars chaos as the narrative hops back and forth from the developing Mars situation to the one on the ground at NASA headquarters and Californias Jet Propulsion Lab where a bunch of brainiacs  led by Jeff Daniels as NASA director  are in constant McGyver mode while struggling to formulate plans to bring their boy back home to Earth. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, Kristen Wiig round out the cast of earth-bound heroes. Theres even a self-reverential Lord of the Rings joke involving Sean Bean that nearly brings down the house.

The Martian will eventually find itself planted amongst the best in Ridley Scotts bulging anthology as it is perfectly paced, visually stunning, and mentally challenging. And despite its two-hour-plus runtime it never feels bloated like many of his other epics. Its one of the few films that demands to be viewed in the 3D format, not for throwing objects at our faces, but for emphasizing the breadth, depth, and isolated beauty of the stunning martian landscape. Even though we know Watney is the only human left on Mars, theres an unmistakably palpable sense of another imposing presence that comes from the planet itself thanks to Ridley Scotts brilliant storytelling and those goofy glasses."
AAV_Doc6_TheMartian,Abhilash Ashok Velaan,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Martian,"Is there life on Mars? Perhaps, but what we do know is that theres certainly water.

No Hollywood studio in the world could choreograph a publicity stunt quite like it: on the opening week of The Martian, NASA discovers that there is indeed life-giving water on Mars. High fives all round, and the marketing department can take a well-deserved break.

But to be fair, The Martian sorely needed a publicity boost like this; without it, the film was careening its way towards a much sorrier fate.

The story goes as follows: after being left for dead on Mars by his comrades after a mission goes a bit awry, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) finds himself living on Mars, alone and with a finite supply of food.

As luck would have it, Watney is a botanist, and as he reminds himself and us after growing a crop of potatoes on the hostile Martian terrain, the finest botanist on the planet.

Meanwhile, the boffins down at NASAs headquarters in Texas  and by god, are they boffins  have realised the crews mistake, and are on a mission to save their guy.

The main problem? It takes about four years to reach the planet from Texas. Its all highly reminiscent of the Tom Hanks vehicle Cast Away, in which a man was left to his own devices, presumed dead, on a remote island.

So far, so intriguing, and with Ridley Scott in the directors chair, a rollicking good time is all but guaranteed, right? Eh, wrong.

Certainly, The Martian looks lavish, as one might expect from Scott, who is the grand don of sci-fi. And while theres no arguing with Damons movie-star credentials, he doesnt carry the film in quite the same way as Tom Hanks did with Cast Away.

Watney is the fulcrum of the film, and sadly, the writers of The Martian (Drew Goddard and Andy Weir) havent fleshed out the character of Watney fully enough for us to be stuck with him for much of the movie.     Certainly, he comes out with some witty one-liners to his video log (potatoes with Vicodin for dinner. I ran out of ketchup this week), but theres no backstory, no interiority, and no look at the psychological ramifications of being alone in space for months on end.

He grows a beard and drops a few pounds; other than that, it seems as though Watney might be perfectly content to spend eternity in the ether once he had grub.

Theres plenty of scrimping, too, when it comes to using his comrades (played by a stellar list, among them Jessica Chastain and Rooney Mara). 

Theyre all criminally underplayed and under-explored: Chastains character Lewis likes disco music, and thats as far as we get with her. That theres no sniff of a love interest or a family for Watney is a nicely skewed clich, but this would have helped to get some meat on this otherwise paltry tale. Similarly, any efforts at tension, like Watneys spuds coming a cropper, come to very little.

What we do get is a lot of science; in fact, were clobbered about the head with quantum physics and other technological jargon, constantly. Everyone sounds very clever and committed to their work its just such a shame theyre all so boring.

If youre a sci-fi nerd, there is plenty to like in The Martian. As Watney says, he will survive his time on Mars if he can science the sh** out of this. Sadly, youll feel every bit as scienced out.

Its the nearest most of us will get to feeling like weve lived on Mars for an eternity. And thats not saying a lot."
AAV_Doc7_TheMartian,Abhilash Ashok Velaan,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Martian,"In The Martian, Matt Damon plays a cosmonaut as emotionally barren as the ochre planet on which hes stranded. Ridley Scotts latest film is a robotic exaltation of science, problem-solving and ingenuity; if you can tolerate the gaping logical perforations on its admittedly rambunctious surface, youll still have to wade through a sea of Cold War-era pro-American sentiment to see the human drama, which is relegated to the sub-subtext. Indeed, rather than grapple with the solitude of their protagonist, Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard use science to build a protective armour around him, shielding the spaceman from his own loneliness and the now-quaint idea of human vulnerability.1 Instead were served volleys of irrepressible optimism and resourcefulness, all unchipped by the physical and emotional tolls that accompany the nine-hundred days spent alone on a planet in which human life is completely untenable. This pre-Freudian man has no repressible attributes  hes a perky ego in a spacesuit. When it comes time for the inevitable triumph-of-the-human-spirit that necessitates his regurgitated survival narrative, all that computes is smugness and nationalism. The human spirit cant triumph if its anethetised by entirely synthetic concepts.

Damon plays NASA botanist Mark Watney, abandoned eighteen days into a Mars reconnaissance mission after a brutal dust storm sweeps him astray of his crew, who hurry back to Earth under the assumption that Watney is dead. Dazed, but stable enough to set up fort in the pod-like lodgings left behind, Watney is struck by an ingenious but unlikely plan for survival  one of a dozen lightbulb moments that act as jet fuel for The Martians narrative. He doesnt think or strategise, the ideas simply come to him, and he espouses them in frivolous bits of diaristic exposition spoken directly to camera. Meanwhile on Earth, NASA boss Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) and his team (Kristen Wiig, Chiwitel Ejiofor, Donald Glover  a rather distracting conglomeration of actors known for severely divergent genres) decide not to inform the still space-bourne crew that Watney is alive on the red planet, leaving them lingering in ignorance. Aboard that ship, stranded in narrative purgatory, are Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Michael Pena and a few other minor players, unquestioningly flat creations who work at NASAs service with unwavering glee. Nine-hundred days fly by as Scott flings us between these three sets  Earthlings, the Martian and the crew in-between.

Its disappointing to see Ridley Scott  who launched his formidable career by looking upward to the cosmos and turning its inky-black reaches into a miasma of dread and isolation in 1979s Alien  so disinterested in the wider universes fictive possibilities. After the bungled (but at least ambitious) space-nonsense of Prometheus and the cataclysmically scrambled spectacle of last years Exodus: Gods and Kings, Scott plays a safe hand with this mythology-free (science only!) survivor story based on Andy Weirs self-published book of the same name, and adapted for the screen by Goddard. Its the latters script that dictates The Martians perky mood and bro-talk shtick, which are borrowed straight from the Marvel Studios playbook.2 Here, outside of the Marvel wheelhouse, its arbitrariness has never felt more glaringly obvious. The most memorable one liners  Im gonna have to science the shit out of this!, Fuck Mars!  hinge upon your susceptibility for laughing at swear words. This sensibility is aided by the bouncy soundtrack, filled with disco-era gems from Vicki Sue Robinson, The OJays and Abba, and sutured into the narrative in a conceit imitative of the mix tape in James Gunns Guardians of the Galaxy. The forced-upon disco sends Watney, who listens begrudgingly, up the wall, but were obviously encouraged to enjoy it like one would a guilty pleasure. The discord between actual pleasure and ironic condescension feels awkward and anachronistic  what is this, 1983? And the ideology matches the music. Emotional frailty and imagination are expunged from Scotts distinctly American ideal vision of the future, as though its in the countrys best interests that these imperceivably happy characters be constantly working with a sense of near-communist wartime glee, their personal and emotional lives censored from the films purview. The Cold War symbolism of NASA as a boastful source of nationhood is reinflated, with Damon shouldering the role of the brave explorer. I colonised Mars, says Watney, in your face Neil Armstrong! Its a sentiment thats easy to buy but  like much palatable American commercialism is want to do  it stains your teeth. The Martian humours the idea that the astronaut is the ideal form on a hierarchy of human life, so brave and noble that billions can be spent to salvage his life without once questioning the inherent aristocracy that this act entails.

That The Martian is postured to become a substantial hit says more about the changing predilections of the market than it does about the merits of the work itself; Scott plays into the hands of a culture dominated by washed, likeable heroes that lack emotional substance, a culture increasingly reliant on spectacle, humour, watertight sci-fi mythology and fleshed out cinematic universes. Damons effortless ingenuity and sanguine charm make his Mark Watney a fashionable protagonist, swaggering into sequence alongside a murderers row of cheesy cutouts that precede him: Ant Man, Iron Man and Star Lord amongst them. I couldnt help but wonder, over and over, whether his bowels could withstand the inane diet of micro-farmed potatoes forced upon them, whether he could cry, or whether he ever once felt lonely or depressed.

For distraction from such pressing matters, The Martian relies on a style that zips along with an effervescent tang, careening through space with the grace of zero-gravity (Jessica Chastain does some lovely floating a la Tree of Life, by the way) and high-spirited jocularity. There are scenes which border on thrilling, like its rescue mission climax evocative of Gravitys swirling, breathtaking opening. But, unlike Sandra Bullocks complex Ryan Stone, these players lack the fundamental depth to inspire outstretches of empathy  the set pieces are momentarily gripping by virtue of their scale, but the human stakes glow about as dimly as a dead planets core. These details might appear secondary to a film this judiciously obsessed with mythbusting its own survival hypothesis, but to audiences back on Earth, where pathos enriches drama and spectacle, and where cinema should do more than just nicely accompany your popcorn, they remain a priority."
AAV_Doc8_TheMartian,Abhilash Ashok Velaan,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Martian,"Matt Damon has lately spent so much onscreen time in space that one begins to worry about how hell reacclimatize to earthbound roles. He dodged flamboyant explosions to infiltrate a posh space station in Neill Blomkamps 2013 Elysium, and last year (in an uncredited maxi-cameo) harbored a confusing hidden agenda as the only inhabitant of an uninhabitable planet in Christopher Nolans Interstellar. His latest movie, The Martian, strands him on the more accessible but no less unfriendly intra-galaxy terrain of the Red Planet, his fellow crew having up and left, presuming him dead after his bio-monitor goes kaput during a sandstorm. This plucky ensemble action movie, the moral of which is that youre in trouble if youre not troubleshooting, comes courtesy of perennial studio trustee Ridley Scott, himself not far removed from the Alien quasi-prequel Prometheus, a space opera that was bathed in a beautiful blue celestial light, and afflicted with an absolutely jaw-dropping attention deficit. (Sequels to the prequel in the pipe.)


Adapted from Andy Weirs novel by Cabin in the Woods writer-director Drew Goddard, The Martian is an appreciably more involving and resourceful film than Prometheusfor a time its fun to watch Damons character, enthusiastically wise-cracking botanist Mark Watney, science the shit out of a host of problems, creating water out of a combustible chemistry-lab setup, deriving vital warmth from decaying plutonium, and so on. The tone, however, soon grows annoyingly flip, as the near-future sci-fi conjures up the recent past. Rather than any more enduring examples of the genre, The Martian perhaps most closely resembles the heedless pyrotechnics of the Bruckheimer back catalogueparticularly Michael Bays 1998 Armageddon, with its NASA cheerleading and proudly dumb (and entirely unmodulated) comic relief. Watneys running commentary on the awfulness of discothe only music he has access to, a cache of instantly recognizable hit singles having been left behind by mission commander Jessica Chastainhas to be one of the most beat-to-death jokes in recent cinema. In a suite of scenes that mostly serve to take this otherwise efficient movie off course, Donald Glover appears as an (ostensibly lovably hapless) on-the-spectrum astrophysicist, rubbing his superiorsand any viewers wary of such deep-dish clichsthe wrong way.

NASAfronted here by Jeff Daniels, whose war room also hosts Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kristen Wiig, and Sean Beaneventually catches on that Watneys still alive, and Scott does instill a sense of urgency to the constant timetable revising that ensues once the parties establish contact: how soon can a rescue mission blast off, and how long can Watney subsist on his Turin Horse ration of boiled potatoes? As pure numbers-game suspense, the movie passes inspection, but the relative absence of soul searching, particularly by the protagonist, makes it seem a specious vehicle for the trumpeting of such human (well, substantially American) values as cooperation, perseverance, and self-sacrifice. The story depends on long-shot odds, but nothing here actually feels hard-won. Watney does break down a few times in end-of-the-road frustration, but the height of solitude doesnt otherwise seem to faze him muchtheres not much desperation to his survive-at-all-costs determination. Mostly hes content to deliver upbeat TV-host-style explanations of his spacehackspretty clever, he has to admitinto his home bases video log, the content of which would take so long to transmit to Earth that he treats the camera like a companion, if not a confessor. In space, no one can hear you humblebrag. You can feel free to be a little bit insufferable.

AAV_Doc9_TheMartian,Abhilash Ashok Velaan,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Martian,"Flashback to the films Interstellar and Gravity. Now hold that thought. This latest voyage into outer space places itself firmly between the two. Its not as sterile as the former and not nearly as OMG entrancing as the latter. The entertainment value is steady, but once the premise is set, the storyline becomes predictable.

The screenplay by Drew Goddard, the ingenious writer of World War Z, is based on an original novel by computer programmer-turned-writer Andy Weir. Goddards hard task was to take a book filled with figures, science and math equations and bring it to life. What he has created is a screenplay full of vigor, somewhat conventional, oddly humorous, sometimes emotional and intermittently engaging. Director Ridley Scott adds directorial guidance and slick, professional production elements (think Prometheus). His glossy, overbearing style is balanced by the animated cast, which humanizes the characters.

On Mars, a space crew is carrying out their duties. A windstorm arrives. It becomes more and more intense and violent. They try to make it back to their landing vessel. Flying debris knocks astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) out of sight into a cloud of dust. Its a tough choice, but Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) decides to hurry her subordinates back onboard, thinking Watney could not have survived the hit. Lewis and her crewmates (Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Aksel Hennie, Sebastian Stan) head back to earth, which is a yearlong journey.

Back on earth, the head of NASA (Jeff Daniels) holds a press conference, announcing Watneys death. Little does anyone know that Watney survived. As a trained botanist and mechanical engineer, he figures out how to stretch rations, make water and grow potatoes. Everyone is shocked when a satellites camera picks up images of Mars, and they notice objects have been moved around. NASA and its California-based Jet Propulsion Laboratory form a think tank with the brightest minds (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover) in an effort to communicate with the astronaut and devise a plan to bring him back to earth.

Damons warm sense of humor makes the stranded insular Watney affable. Hard not to like his plucky nature. Daniels as the head of NASA is most concerned with branding and his organizations image in the media. Ejiofors earnest performance is a great contrast to Daniels, as he plays NASAs Director of Mars missions; a man more interested in the astronauts wellbeing. Donald Glover portrays an orbital dynamicist at JPL, and is suitably animated as a geek seeking solutions. Chastain, Pena and Mara are all fine within their limited amount of screen time. Saturday Night Live alumna Kristen Wiig, as an oddball media executive, gives an out-of-place performance, like shes fleshing out a quirky character in an SNL skit in the middle of a dramatic movie.

The music by Harry Gregson-Williams (Shrek), cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (Prometheus), costumes by Janty Yatesav (Gladiator) and production design by Arthur Max (Prometheus) are near perfect at setting atmosphere. This is Ridley Scotts strong suit as a producer; he always assembles a high-end, unflappable tech crew. But in some cases his grandiose production elements overwhelm the storyline and characters (Body of Lies, American Gangster).

If you see trailers for The Martian, and start to have a dj vu experience, you are not alone. Matt Damon had an unbilled role in the film Interstellar where he also played a stranded astronaut. Only in that film he wasnt such a nice guy. Why he decided to play the same kind of character in less than a year is a mystery only he and his agent can answer.

As 141 minutes roll by, the visuals (especially of Marss rusty orange/brown landscape), and performances (Damon and Ejiofor have the juiciest roles), help to pique interest and entertain. Yet this film feels like a retread and when you walk out of the theater you may not feel satiated. Something about this whole project feels like it should have been an extended TV series like Lost. It just doesnt have the gravitas, originality or layers of undercurrent with far-reaching themes that made Gravity and 2001: A Space Odyssey better movies.

A half-hour into the Wizard of Oz, you can predict that Dorothy will make it back to Kansas. A half-hour into The Martian any seasoned moviegoer can figure out where the plotline in this feel-good movie has to go. Thats a shame and the films biggest transgression."
AAV_Doc10_TheMartian,Abhilash Ashok Velaan,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Martian,"The riposte, and it's a fair one, is: What would make you happy? And the frustrating response is, ""I don't know."" The problem is this (and in a movie about solving problems, it's germane to raise one): that The Martian, Ridley Scott and Drew Goddard's faithful adaptation of Andy Weir's bestseller, is essentially a bwana story in which smart and resourceful black and Chinese people band together to save a white explorer who declares himself both ""colonizer"" and ""pirate"" at various points in the movie. It's a summary of a certain kind of film, too, the space opera that used to be all the rage in the 1950s--a decade actually interested in exploration rather than defunding NASA and rabid anti-intellectualism. The only thing missing is a space chimp and a space lady with rockets in her brassiere. I confess that I probably wouldn't have even been thinking much, or perhaps as quickly, about the racial politics of this film had Matt Damon, the bwana in question, not ""whitesplained"" to a black producer (a female black producer) what diversity means as regards his wish-fulfillment reality series ""Project Greenlight"". Or if it weren't directed by Ridley Scott, whose last film, Exodus: Gods and Kings, required volumes of whitesplaining itself as to why the principals of his Middle Eastern/African tale were white.

So what would have made me happy? If an Asian (there must be one of the 2 billion of us on the planet up to the task) were cast as ber-starman Mark Watley instead of Damon? I don't know--because, you know, casting an Asian as someone as resourceful and good at math as Mark is could be seen as something of a stereotype in itself--though of course the head of JPL on Earth is a portly Chinese guy who doesn't get a credit on IMDb, naturally, although he's a major player. What if Mark were a black guy--Idris Alba, perhaps. Of course he's too street for Bond, so he'd be way too street for an astronaut. Maybe Don Cheadle. Or Terrence Howard, who gets a whole article on how he's a crazy person while Mark Wahlberg gets a lifetime pass for beating an Asian guy for being Asian. What about a woman? I guess it doesn't really matter because, for the most part, The Martian doesn't really care. I don't mean doesn't care in a Gene Roddenberry sense, but doesn't care as in there isn't character development in all of the 140+ minutes of The Martian so much as there's a description of types and then a collection of pretty scenes and expert vistas. The only reason I'm raising this racial question at all is because The Martian doesn't do anything to replace that conversation with a different one. I guess what would have made me happy is a movie that's about something other than pluck.

As in the book, a manned mission to Mars aborts suddenly, stranding Mark, thought dead. But he's not dead. This makes for an embarrassing public relations thing for NASA head Teddy (Jeff Daniels, who, between this and Steve Jobs, has reached terminal let's-have-a-friendship-break velocity), his PR officer (Kirsten Wiig, tragically wasted), and head of something-something Boromir (Sean Bean), who lands the single best joke in the entire thing--a joke so meta, so brilliant, that it almost saves the entire movie by itself. The film then flits back and forth between Mark trying to stay alive on Mars with limited resources and NASA--and eventually CNSA--trying to rescue him with unlimited resources. See, it's science-fiction. It's a weird sort of fantasy, too, in that it posits an Earth, a United States, that actually cares about exploration for its own sake enough to fund it. The Martian joins Interstellar in that way as hopeful shots across the Conservative bow. Its hero is a botanist of all things who figures out how to cultivate Martian soil to extend his life on the planet for a couple hundred crucial days as the mostly black and Chinese scientists back on Earth figure out a way to rescue him. Fair? I don't know. I do wish that The Martian had given me something else to discuss beyond how this is a slightly more multi-cultural Cast Away--or, you know, a Robinson Crusoe on Mars where you also get to see the work put into rescuing the hero from the other side. It would've been better with a monkey, though.

Bloated, dry as a soda cracker, and 100% safe for awards-season consumption, The Martian can be allied with those old Merchant/Ivory productions as well. It's a period piece, a costume drama; the lead is witty and of marriageable age, and we presume he comes from a good family, though the film can find no time for this despite its distended length. Plus, like those musty old Merchant/Ivorys, it's utterly professional and appears right around the time that old folks' thoughts turn towards Oscar telling them what they should watch. Even most of the ""fucks"" are redacted to preserve delicate sensibilities. I'm not kidding. It's the easy-to- masticate and digest version of Philip Kaufman's The Right Stuff in almost exactly the same way that Spotlight is the fallen-and-can't-get-up version of All the President's Men: elderly films of a stately demeanour targeted--laser-sighted, in fact--to a very specific demographic that wants their action tame, their sex not to be spoken of, their heroes white as a sheet, and the hero's helpers all the colours of the multicultural rainbow. What does it say that The Martian makes Apollo 13 seem lively? It didn't used to be like this. There was a time when major movie studios were producing things like Apocalypse Now that had, still has, zero fucks to give about whether you like it or not. The Martian is ingratiating like Eddie Haskell. It's a bushel of corn, boiled just so with a little butter and salt on a warm Iowa day. You should read Ray Bradbury's ""Mars is Heaven,"" just for a quick reminder of what fairytales of succour inevitably turn out to be."
